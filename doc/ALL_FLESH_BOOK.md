### Presentation.

Hello, my name is José Luis Quiroga Beltrán, the objective of this video
is to give you some good news and others that do not seem good.

I love Logic. I love the Truth. I love life. I love freedom. I love the
Justice. I hope to be faithful to you throughout this presentation. And power
show the arguments, concepts, evidence, and how they
that love took me, made me love, Yeshua, my Father, his Spirit and
to the set of texts commonly known by the name of the Bible.

So this video is also an invitation for you to search,
research, study, read, analyze those arguments, concepts,
evidence, historical sources, on your own and come to your
own conclusions. And in a particular and special way, an invitation
to do this with the texts known as the Bible.

### Caveat.

As a warning, I must say that throughout this video, and with
the sole intention of making communication more effective: I am going to use
any resource of action that it deems appropriate.

I'm going to act this presentation. I will emphasize different
times and in different ways. I will repeat, I will clarify, I will
raise the tone of voice. I will seem excited, angry, sarcastic,
mocking, sad, happy. I'm going to sing, I'm going to pray, I'm going to read the bible,
I am going to dance, I am going to do what I consider necessary to communicate what
What do I want to communicate? The goal is not just to keep their attention. It is
communicate an idea.

I hope to achieve my goal.

For example, at any time I can close my eyes, raise my
head and hands and say something like:

Heavenly Father, I ask you in the name that is above all names, in the
name of your son Jesus Christ, of Yeshua Hamashiakh, that you give me the
wisdom, grace and power to communicate news effectively. What
to the people who see this video open their eyes so they can
see and ears so they can hear. That you drag them to your son
Jesus Christ and the truth of **your** story in **the** story and **me**
history.

Or he may start singing at any time:

Our hearts, insatiable they are

Don't worry, I'm not going to convince you that the Bible is true. I
I can not do this. What I am going to do is quote and read the verses
of the bible that I consider necessary to communicate what I want
communicate. And let them be Logic and Life itself, at the right moment,
those that reveal the Truth in your mind, in your heart and in all
His person.

You are warned.

### Questions.

If someone says "I believe in the Bible and I believe in science", or "I believe in the
bible and I believe in the truth”, or “I believe in the bible and I believe in logic”,
depending on the person listening to it, it is very easy to think that said person or
don't know much about one, or don't know much about the other, or live in
permanent contradiction and does not care.

This is because when you know something about the Bible, something about the
science and something about logic, at least that which is learned in the
school, at the university, and in the media, there are
Many questions:

If the universe is 6 thousand years old, the time that has passed since the
Creation according to the bible, how is it possible that we see stars that
are millions of light years away?

How is it possible that dinosaurs lived 80 million years ago?
years and that the bible is also true?

How is it possible that the universe has existed for more than 14 thousand
millions of years and that the bible is also true?

How is it possible that the theory of evolution and the bible are both
true?

If hell is a place of punishment, permanent eternal and conscious
by means of fire and brimstone, where people who
did evil, how can a good God allow evil, the
suffering and torture continue to exist forever and ever
in that hell?

If it is true what Jesus Christ says that no one goes to the father except through him,
Does Adam go to heaven or hell?

Why in the bible the lake of fire that was NEVER translated as
hell, now it turned out that it is hell, and the Hebrew Sheol that WAS
translated in several parts as hell, now it turned out a place to which
go all the dead, the good and the bad?

If God is good, he is love, he wants the salvation of all and there is nothing
impossible for him, why only a few are saved?

Someone who lived in Japan, in the year 900 after Christ, who never
met Christ, who lived an exemplary life compared to most
of Christians today, do you go to heaven or hell? finally what?
Is it necessary, or is it not necessary, to believe in Christ to be saved?

Someone who lived a life of evil, in which he raped, tortured and murdered
hundreds of children during his 70-odd years of life, he dies and leaves
to hell, to suffer forever and ever, consciously, for
fire and brimstone, in permanent torture. Do you not receive as punishment, a
suffering, a torture, an evil, superior, for all eternity, to
the one he did for only 70 and a half years? Is that from a just God?

Is it not a systematic, conscious, physical, eternal punishment, by fire and
sulfur, of permanent torture, worse than any system of
systematic annihilation such as the "Final Solution" implemented by
Hitler's Nazis during the Holocaust of World War II?
After all, after death, nothing hurts. while to
those who are in hell everything hurts for all eternity. The
Hell seems more like an idea of ​​the Marquis de Sade. The one from which the
sadistic word.

If Jesus Christ taught us that one should love one's enemies, why did God
He sends his enemies to conscious, physical and eternal suffering in the
hell?

How is it possible that the chronology of Egyptian history and the Bible
are both true? What came first the pyramids or the flood?

How to explain that a good God, who knows the heart of man, who
he gives him the commandment "not to kill" on some stone tablets; that he
himself selects a king for his people, named Saul, through his
prophet; that after all that, after all that, he goes and orders
that King Saul, through his prophet, go and kill, murder, women,
old people, children, even the breastfed, men and animals, EVERYTHING, and not
leave anything alive in Amalek?[^1] That is, first he gives the commandment of
"do not kill" and then goes and orders the king, who He chose, to go and kill
even the cat in Amalek.

The king goes and kills, assassinates, women, children, even the breastfed, elderly,
men and animals, kills EVERYTHING, murders EVERYTHING, even the cat [^2]. Only
leaves the king of Amalek and the best animals alive, with the intention
to also kill the animals in sacrifice to that God who gave him the
order to kill everything and probably also kill the king in front of
YHWH, as indeed later the prophet did.

No, that good God, who knows everything, who many years before had given
the commandment not to kill, but now it seems that it has changed
seem and gives him the order to kill women, old men and children (even the
chest) to the king that He chose, says to his prophet: "I
he regrets having made Saul king” [^3], “he has not kept my words”.
Could it be that God did not know that this was going to happen? Because it seems not.

Saul only left alive the king of Amalek and the best animals for
sacrifice them burned to the God who gave him the order, but God decides
change it. That King Saul is no use to you. Then he tells his prophet: let
to cry for Saúl, stop yelling for that *man*, I already discarded him, I
I'm out of that mancito, go to Bethlehem I'm going to tell you for whom
I'm going to replace it [^4]. And the prophet tells him: but how am I going to leave?
If Saúl finds out, he kills me. And God tells him: cool, take a heifer and
tell him that a sacrifice is to be offered to Jehovah. Use it for that God
that speaks to him [^5].

How to explain this good God, who knows everything, but who orders to kill
after having ordered not to kill and that one lives regretting what
did you know what was going to happen?

That same God who forgot to put as a commandment "not to enslave",
perhaps because now he wants us as slaves.

And the snakes, they talk.

And the talking donkeys.

And that we all came out of a couple.

And that first were the land and the sea and then the stars.

And that everything was created in 7 days. Those who have morning and afternoon.

And that some guys live in a desert eating bread that falls from the sky for
forty years.

And that with a stick the seas are opened so that thousands of people can pass,
but only for a little while as they pass, and then they close on top of a
army that persecuted them, drowning all of the army.

And that Noah, and the little animals in a little boat, during a year in which a
forty-day deluge filled the entire planet with water.

And that Noah had his children around 500 and some years old. Would they be years old?

And that before the flood people lived about 900 years.

And that a big fish swallows a guy and after 3 days spits him out in a
beach. This Jonah.

And that the dead rise.

Where are they? In heaven or in hell?

It doesn't seem very scientific or logical. Do not?

Many questions arise. Many of them assume other questions. Many
of them they assume things that the bible does not say. Many of them assume
things that science does not say.

This video is not going to answer these questions one by one. Rather have
the intention to kill all the birds with one stone, as an objective
addition to giving some good news and others that do not seem good.

PART 2. CENTER.

### Creator.

#### Technical creativity.

The technical creativity of man has allowed him to build airplanes,
shoes, cell phones, microscopes, telephones, watches, televisions,
hammers, trains, telescopes, computers, pots, buildings,
transistors, automobiles, satellites, refrigerators, washing machines, polishers,
backhoes, machines that make machines, factories that use
machines made by other factories to build OBJECTS that
make it easier for man to meet his basic needs for food, clothing, toilet
and housing.

Technical creativity always results in an object, something
palpable, perceptible through the senses, something material, something
concrete, a machine, a technology, something that alters the perceptible and
that change is noticeable.

Technical creativity is by far the most important, most
reliable, to validate any scientific model or theory.

No one can rationally say today: "I don't believe in airplanes", "No, no,
is that, I do not believe in airplanes”.

But about 1000 years ago it was quite easy for someone to say no.
believes that one day thousands of machines made of metal would be built,
that fly, that have wings like birds, that carry hundreds of
people inside and weighing tons. About 1000 years ago it was
much easier to say “I don't believe in airplanes”.

No one can rationally say today: "I don't believe in computers", "No,
no, it's just, I don't believe in computers”.

But only about 500 years ago it was quite easy for someone to say
who does not believe that one day billions of
machines that would allow billions of sums or
multiplications in a second, which would have memory and which would allow
a communication, in which you see a person, who is thousands of
miles away, using something like a mirror, his tablet,
in which the other person is reflected and you can hear the other
person, with the voice of the other person, coming out of the “mirror”, and
speak to the person addressing the “mirror”. That was a story for
children since the 1600s: the witch from Little Red Riding Hood. today is called
video conferencing and is used by millions of people around the
planet Earth.

However, the same cannot be said of the very large, the very far,
the very small, the past, the future.

Who has built a star, a galaxy?

Who has built something from elementary particles?

Who has built a second, a minute, an hour?

The technical creativity of the human being, that which we use on a daily basis,
has not reached that point, although there is probably no lack of those who believe that
Yes.

Technical creativity excludes any discipline that does not build its
object of study or something with its objects of study. Study the
stars but does not build them and does not build anything with them?. Do not
qualifies. He studies the elementary particles but doesn't he build them and doesn't
build anything with them? Does not qualify. He studies time but doesn't he?
builds and builds nothing with it?. Does not qualify. study gravity
but does not build it and does not build anything with it?. He doesn't qualify.
He studies the genes but does he build them for us and not build anything with
they?. Guess what?: DOES NOT QUALIFY.

That means that the scientific theories that speak of this type of
things are not so scientific. They are not really knowledge. They are a
field of study, are a set of hypotheses that have not been validated
for a TECHNICAL CREATIVITY.

This means that the conceptual position of this video in front of the
demarcation problem is to use TECHNICAL CREATIVITY as a "criterion
of demarcation” between what IS and what is not science. That is the
position of this video in front of the problem of demarcation.

When we build machines to build stars and galaxies of the
what we see through the telescope, when we build machines to travel in
the time, when we build machines to travel billions
of times what many believe to be the maximum possible - the speed of
the light in the void, that which they have not been able to find and that which is assumed
as a maxim in the fundamental axiom of some very famous theories - and
let's visit the stars, when we can make another type of matter
based on other types of elementary particles, different from those that
we believe they exist, when all this can be done by man and is of
common use, such as a washing machine or a cell phone, we can begin to say that
The theories that explain these constructions are scientific. Are
knowledge. Not the rest.

When it is rationally impossible to say: "I don't think we will travel to the
stars”, when it is rationally impossible to say: “I do not believe in the
travel in time”, for the common person, in the same way in
that it is now rationally impossible to say: "I do not believe in airplanes",
For an ordinary person, we can say that technical creativity is already
confirmed the "scientific" theories that explain space and time
that level.

Meanwhile no. Meanwhile they are just fields of study.

The word "science" and the word "know" have become synonymous with
"certainty" in the minds of most people.

There are people who believe they are certain of what happened millions of years ago.
years. "It's scientifically proven." "We know". “Science already
proved."

Technical creativity is a better criterion than the more commonly
used to determine if a hypothesis is scientific or not. Much
more reliable, than any other criteria, because it creates objects that
anyone can use. This criterion avoids ending up calling
"science" to what is only a field of study.

##### Application.

The application of the criterion is limited by the technology created. A
technology only validates the theories or models that were necessary and
determining factors for its creation and reproduction. Not the ones AFTER
created the technology are used to explain it, or those that were used as
support, but that the SAME could have been created WITHOUT them, which are not
determinants.

An example is transistors. Necessary and determining theories
for the first patents, in 1925 and 1934, of the FET, the
field-effect-transistor were electromagnetics and chemistry. The
The same name tells us how it works: the word "field" refers to
to an electric field. Its functional parts, the semiconductors, are
explained with electromagnetic logic and produced with chemistry. The
first semiconductors and diodes are created in the 19th century when these
theories were already mature.

If AFTER someone uses a statistical ideology of particles
elements to explain the FET, according to the criterion of creativity
technique, this theory is not validated because it was never needed for the
creation of the first FETs.

An ideology of elementary particle statistics, imagined in the
20th century, it was NOT used to build the first semiconductors, or
diodes, in the 19th century, or transistors, or FETs, which are an extension
logic of the electromagnetic behavior of the diode. processes were used
existing and maturing chemical and electromagnetic theory.

The explanation taught in educational institutions of how
a transistor, a diode, or a semiconductor works is not from
a statistical theory of elementary particles because there is no need
to explain them. It is like explaining how to make a “soup” with a
ideology of alchemy. It wont be necesary.

The application of the criterion is limited by the technology created.

#### Technical complexity.

Greater technical complexity requires greater technical creativity, and
vice versa. The complexity of the machines, of the technology, which can
build man increases as his technical creativity increases,
and vice versa. One is a reflection of the other.

No one can rationally say that "it is easier to make a computer
to make a knife. make a computer? Uff very easy, piece of cake,
anyone can do it. Make a knife? Ahh no, that's no way, no
idea, no one knows how. Making the computer requires more creativity
technique.

Technical creativity is something that grows, that is learned, that is
develops, with the experience of using it and practicing it. It is a process of
the mind. Animals don't have it. The development of creativity
technique is a process in which the greater technical creativity is obtained
a greater capacity to develop more complex technologies. Are
statements seem obvious. However, there is always the person who
like to deny the obvious.

We watch and download a video we like on the Internet and forget what
what was necessary for that to happen.

Watching a video on the Internet implies having built factories to manufacture
each of the parts and machines necessary to build
processors, screens, automobiles, antennas, fiber optic networks
transcontinental, wireless networks, millions of lines of programs
of software in which if a single line is modified the entire program
could fail, design circuits the size of a small coin that
have as many switches as there are rooms in a city, design
and build the tracks along which the finished products are transported
and means of transportation such as planes, trucks, and automobiles that
They transported said computer or cell phone until it reached their hands.

A person can use a cell phone without having a clue how it came to be.
build the cell phone, without knowing how it came into your hands, you can use
a car without knowing how they did it. Use a technology produced by
man's technical creativity does not require the user to understand
the details of its development.

You don't have to be a scientist to use products of science.

Therefore, it is very easy to underestimate the great amount of advances in
technical creativity of man when its result is simply used.
The children of today tend to think that the Internet has always been there.

It is easy to forget or ignore that greater technical complexity requires
greater technical creativity, and vice versa.

#### Biology.

One of the most studied fields, through machines such as the microscope
electronic, the result of man's technical creativity, is that of
everything related to plants, animals and man. The biological.

Through these studies it has been found that inside each
of the approximately 37 million million, or 37 teras, of cells,
that the human body has there are very small molecular machines that
they all work at the same time, arming and disarming communication channels,
of transport of other molecular machines that can also be
armed or disarmed as the cell needs, and exchanging
molecules with the environment of the cell that must be recognized
by the cell to allow its entry into the interior of the cell; and that
Inside each cell there is a molecule that contains the program of
how to reconstruct the complete organism formed by these cells, the
famous DNA. It has also been found that there are molecular machines that
verify the consistency of said chain, of DNA, a chain that is
found in duplicate in each cell, and that if it finds any
inconsistency, said molecular machine communicates with others to
fix the error.

This type of machinery that is found inside each cell
and that in an almost equally complex way is found in each
living organism that has a DNA, whether plant or animal, is several
orders of magnitude more complex than the most complex of machines
man made.

The biological machinery is far more complex than the biological machinery.
man made

We observe through man-made technologies like cells
of plants and animals duplicate themselves in a process we call
mitosis, yet we do not see that a car, or a washing machine, or a
cell, reproduces itself. We don't see a car split
in two identical cars.

We observe in sexual animals that if a male and a female unite
after a while a small animal is born from the female with the same
characteristics that grows over time, however we do not see that in a
a blue train and a pink one, let them join, and after a while leave
a little train that grows over time.

We also observed that if I cut my skin superficially, after a few
days the wound has healed and the wound has disappeared. Instead
I have never noticed that if my car gets a dent, it will fix it.
the dent itself. I have always had to take it in for repair.

And if a blood sample is taken from a person, in that sample
obtains all the information on how to make a twin of the person, but
If you measure the oil in a car, in said oil there are no
plans and designs of the parts of that car and how to assemble a car
identical to which the oil was measured. not the same level
complexity.

We don't even understand how the biological machinery works.
enough to reproduce it. If I lose an eye in an accident, no
we know how to reconstruct my eye from my DNA. Or a kidney, or a
lung. We know that there are some stem cells. We don't know how to use
information, the programs, that we know you have.

No one has created a machine that thinks, that can replace being
human. All the machines that man has created need man
at some point to keep running.

Man has no idea how to synthesize, build from scratch, without
use biological raw material, the parts, the molecular machines, that
are needed to build a cell. The human being has no idea
how to build IN a modern laboratory, without using raw material
biology, and starting from elements in the periodic table, a
polysaccharide, a peptide, a nucleotide, 3 of the 4 basic compounds,
or basic molecular machines, to put together a cell. And even if I could
put them together, it would be like being able to write letters of an unknown language without
be able to put together a single coherent sentence.

We have much less idea how to assemble them so that they function as
a cell: a machine that with what is written in its DNA, in that language
unknown, you can run a specific program from the thousands of
programs in the DNA, and copy itself, or build one of these
molecular machines, or build a communicating microtubule
intracellular, or another of the thousands of functions necessary to maintain
the cell functioning, alive.

And we have even less idea how to build different types of cells
to form a human body system like an eye, or like a liver.
And we have even less idea how to code a program containing
all these mechanisms in each of the cells of the human being and that
when the program is executed, it can build a complete human being.

If the machinery inside a cell is several orders of magnitude
more complex than any man-made machine, the organism
of the human being is millions of millions of orders of magnitude
more complex than any machine created by man. a one followed
of millions of millions of zeros more difficult. It is not an exaggeration,
fact is a much larger number of combinations, but this
less is an imaginable number for most people. Cast
not to include the complexity of the interdependence between plants,
animals, man and his environment.

In biology, man still does not have technical creativity. use machines
result of technical creativity to study machinery
biological. It is a field of study, but according to the criteria of
technical creativity is not a science. We don't know how to build machinery
biological from scratch, without using the pre-existing one. We have no idea how
do it.

#### Creator.

There is no doubt that man has great technical creativity.

The question that arises is:

Why do some people think that to build the easy, like
automobiles, airplanes, computers and factories, it takes large
amounts of technical creativity but to build something difficult, something
really difficult, that we don't even understand the mechanism for
reproduce it, like a man, an animal or a plant, for that if you don't
needs nothing, zero, not a bit of technical creativity, but only
time and hump?

It's stupid.

It is as if someone said:

Make a knife? Brilliant ! Very smart! Great Creativity! Than
marvel of technology! What a design!

Make a Computer? Ahh no, that's if you do it alone. That just has to
wait billions of years and it assembles itself. That's not funny.
What nonsense. Look at them there they are. That is the proof that they are armed
alone. That's no problem. There's the proof.

It is absurd to think that to write a program, in a language that does not
I know, that builds a machine that I don't even understand how
works, that I don't even aim to build, that once
built is capable of executing the program, I just need to throw a
coin in the air, to decide if I write, with evaporable ink and on paper
degradable, a one or a zero, and hope that after a long time, in
reality does not matter how much, since the more time passes the probability
is lower, and without even knowing when to stop tossing the coin,
get the mentioned program.

IT'S STUPID !

But that is what some people believe, if they are taught from
little girls at school

It is as if in a future, a man-made machine, which can
think and learn, who calls herself smart, designer and
creative because it is capable of building thousands of other machines, a robot
of the future that can create machines, but does not even understand how
was built himself and that the most complex of his creations is not
capable of doing what he himself can do, he would think: "I am very
smart, designer and creative but my design is a result of
time and hump, my first copy was put together by itself after waiting thousands
of millions of years, I am simply the result of the evolution of
simpler copies that were adapted by accidental changes - or
be hump - in my copy program, for my existence I do not know
needed no intelligence, no design, no creativity, there is NO creator,
there is no evidence that I was created.”

That machine, that robot, has a software problem. has a virus
that is killing him. Which sometimes makes him think absurdly.
You need the antivirus.

On the contrary, if we have to:

1. Greater complexity in a machine requires greater creativity
    technique. [(1)](#0.4.Technical complexity.|outline)
2. The complexity of biological machines is much greater than the
    complexity of man-made machines.
    [(2)](#0.5.Biology.|outline)

It is perfectly logical to conclude that:

Biological machines require much greater technical creativity
than that required by man-made machines.

Then if the human being considers himself intelligent, designer and
creative for all the results, for THE EVIDENCE, of your creativity
technique, has the logical need to recognize that creativity
technique that biological machines require, that EVIDENCE that
we observe in the day to day, imply an intelligence, design and
even more creativity.

And not just a little older. Since the complexity of the machines
biology is millions of millions of orders of magnitude greater than the
of the machines created by man, the technical creativity that created
biological machines have to be much larger. Probably
also millions of millions of orders of magnitude greater than that of the
men.

But no, there are all those who believe that the thing was at the tip of the hump.
And that they believe that this is "scientifically proven".

Which reminds me of something someone said:

"As the heavens are higher than the earth, so my
ways are higher than your ways, and my thoughts are higher than
their thoughts” [^6].

If we are going to consider the human being technically creative, WE HAVE to
recognize that the human being was created by a technical creativity
much older.

And who created the creator? And why do we find errors in the design
of the creator? And when do I create it? Did he believe us and left? still around but
is not seen? These are all questions that admit the existence of a
creator and who seek to know said creator. are all irrelevant to
determine whether or not there is a creator.

The point is that there IS a creator.

Do you want to meet him? He wants the SAME!

#### Evidence.

All the evidence shows us that the human being has creativity
technique, which is a technically creative being.

There are all the machines designed and built by man that
They are becoming more complex and more functional. That is the
evidence of his technical creativity.

There is no evidence that plants or animals have the same
characteristic. Birds always make their nests the same way.
Nothing a plant or animal does increases in complexity. Do not
there are buildings made by birds.

However, all the evidence shows us that those plants, animals and
people, all this biological machinery has a technical complexity
far greater than anything created by man.

Evidence of such a difference in complexity between what the
man and the biological machinery is in what happens to the eye of the
accident, or the liver, or the lung. We don't know how to rebuild it
from my DNA. There are stem cells, but we don't know how to use them
the information, the programs, that we know you have, to reconstruct
a part of our body. For more intelligent, creative and
designers that we are we cannot use such information.

If we could, it would be enough to take a drop of my blood to rebuild
the eye that I lost, or the liver that I lost or the lung that I lost in the
accident. And we would not waste time analyzing
compatibility with another person's kidney, which we know beforehand
it will not be fully supported.

On the other hand, if some process, or program, or system, is the cause of
biological machinery, such a system, would have to have a
technical creativity far superior to that of the human being, or to have
been created by a creativity would have far superior to that of being
human. The greater the technical complexity, the greater the creativity required.
technique.

That system, understood from a computer point of view, would have to
be that of a much higher consciousness, in technical knowledge, than the
of man, and not a simple selection process, which does not add
information, but it removes. Furthermore, it could not be by mechanisms of
chance, hump, accident, or SPONTANEOUS, but by decision mechanisms
of decisions, based on the logic that governs the operation of the
created. That is, similar to what man does when he is creating
machinery, but far superior in technical creativity.

Nor could it be in millions of years, that all they do is
decrease the probability that an interaction will happen between two parties
that degrade over time, which in most cases requires
of specific conditions, including actions to start and stop
the interaction, which further decrease the probability of its happening.
But on the contrary, in a time consistent with the technical capacity
of such technical creativity. That is similar to what man does
when creating machinery, but far superior in creativity
technique.

Nor do we observe spontaneous processes that have technical creativity.
If so, we would have to observe all kinds of machinery of
different types and functionalities, not all biological, but some
resembling human-made machines, something like
transformers, or like those of avatar, increasingly complex, appearing
day to day. But no. We do not observe them in biological systems, only
in our imagination and in the movies that we ourselves
we imagine. They may exist, but we do not observe them. For him
To the contrary, all the evidence indicates that the biological machinery was
designed by a technical creativity far superior to that of man because
it has a complexity far superior to the machinery created by man.

#### Reproduction.

Technical creativity, if it really is, allows repeating over and over
time the same process, allows repeating the mechanism by which
he made an object, a machine, a technology. allows us to reproduce
the machine, the object. That ability is what gives us confidence
necessary in the set of reasoning, mathematical models, theories
scientific, in that information that explains said process. The trust
that this information, these programs, are indeed true, they are
correct, that they work to make the desired machinery, and that this
it will work the way you want.

If we manufacture billions of cell phones almost
automated, that gives us confidence that the information that explains the
manufacturing process and the operation of the cell phone, effectively
works, that such information is indeed scientific.

If my cell phone is stolen or completely destroyed, can I get
another exactly the same and if I have a copy of the information I had in
the cell phone, I can get another cell phone that works exactly the same as the
that was destroyed.

The same does not happen with an ant, or with a dog. If I destroy a
animal I can not reproduce it. I can't get another one mathematically
identical to the one that was destroyed. We don't know how to get a backup copy
to the brain of an ant or a dog. We can't reproduce it
identically because we did not design either the ant or the
dog. We don't have the necessary information.

The most we have achieved is the equivalent of running the
copy program, we call them clones, because the result is an animal
with exactly the same DNA. But we don't understand how it works.
Program. We only know how to implement it.

If we understood how it works, we could build an eye, or a
kidney, for you, from a drop of your blood. We can not. Do not
we know how Maybe one day we can and only ever will
achieved is to show that great technical creativity was required as
just to be able to understand the biological machinery. we would be adding
evidence to the argument of the existence of a creator of the machinery
biological.

But that creator, who by logic and evidence must exist, if he is
that we are going to call ourselves designers, intelligent and
creative, that if you know how the little program works.

That creator if he could, if he wants, reproduce any of
these biological machines that he designed, should they be destroyed,
the same way we do with a cell phone. What's more, if you
If you feel like it, you could take the backup information, or copy of
security, of the software, and place it in a more advanced version of the
hardware, of this biological machinery. You could, for example, place
all the software, all the memory, that the person had at the time of
his physical death, in a version 2.0 body, in one of greater durability,
in a more resistant one, one that resists, for example, fire. Sure, not
we would be talking about the creator that the bible speaks but about one
imagined by a person of this century. something the bible calls
sin.

### Resurrection.

#### Future.

Today, with advances in human-made technology, it is
easy to imagine a future, even distant, of say a million years,
in which it is possible to make exact copies of a biological machine
quite complex: the human body. If in said future it is possible to obtain
a backup of the position of each atom in an object
anyone and reproduce said object, why not with the human body?

The resulting atom-by-atom three-dimensional impression could
remember everything the person remembered up to the time of the copy.
Then, when printing is finished, the printed person could
wonder: Who won the game of Russian roulette that we were
Playing?

And of course you can imagine a future in which the
aging of the person achieving that during the mitosis of the
cells of the organism does not reduce the number of telomeres of its
chromosome, that copy counter that determines the maximum number of
copies that can be made of a given cell.

Technologies such as cloning, cell regeneration, printing
three-dimensional and computing, allow us to imagine a future in which the
man with technology created by himself, could simulate a life
eternal and a resurrection. There are already several movies dealing with the subject.

But if this is eternal life and resurrection that can imagine a
man of the year 2021, counted from the approximate year he was born
the King of Kings, the Meshiakh of YHWH; What will eternal life be like?
resurrection imagined by the person who designed and created this brain that
can imagine and create things in the image and likeness of their creator?

How are those things that eye did not see and ear did not hear to which he refers
Paul in the second chapter of the first letter to the Corinthians? [^7],
And what were prepared before the creation of heaven and earth?
earth according to the first chapter of the letter to the Ephesians? [^8]

Let's see what the Bible says.

#### Physical.

The resurrection described in the Bible is physical.

Yeshua, according to Luke 24, after being resurrected, appears in
through his apostles and says to them: “Look at my hands and my
feet, which I myself am. Feel and see, because a spirit does NOT have flesh
nor bones as you see that I HAVE” [^9]. And at that moment she accepted and ate
fish in front of them. To Thomas in John 20 he says: “Put your finger here
and look at my hands, put your hand here and stick it in my side, and don't be
unbeliever but believer” [^10]. And Thomas kneels down and says: "Lord
mine, and my God” [^11]. The Bible tells us of a physical resurrection,
has a body, can be touched, can eat, the person who resurrects, does not
it is something abstract, it is not a spirit, it is something physical and has flesh and
bones.

It also tells us about a resurrection that has memory, they
recognize as the same person who was crucified, who died, and who was
buried, and is now among them again. They can hug him
they can touch, eats fish, has an interaction with them equal to the
from before he died. He has the same physical appearance as before he died,
preserves the wounds of feet and hands. It is not that I return in a body of
a woman or a child, or in a completely different body, or in a
hen or a dog. No, it is not a reincarnation. She is the same person.
He has the same memories and they remember him. that's the resurrection
which the Bible tells us about.

So if I see and talk to the dead but I can't touch them and
they cannot eat fish, if it is not something physical, but purely
spiritual, like the dead man seen by King Saul through a witch in
the first book of Samuel, he is most likely talking to a
spirit that will be anything but Holy, one of those that impersonate
for dead, and not simply a mental problem. rising from between
the dead that our Lord announces is physical.

#### They can't die.

Furthermore, the resurrection described in the Bible is a resurrection that is
not to die because he can no longer die. Yeshua tells some Sadducees,
in Luke 20, that: "they can no longer die because they are like angels, and they are
also sons of God being sons of the resurrection” [^12], is a
resurrection that is forever. That's the resurrection he's talking about
our Lord.

Paul, in 1 Corinthians 15, explains that “It is sown in
corruption will arise in incorruption” [^13], it can no longer die. Plus
later also in 1 corinthians 15, it says that: “And just as
we have borne the image of the earthly, we will also bear the image of the
heavenly” [^14]. That is, in bodies similar to those of angels, or
to that of our Lord after being resurrected. In Philippians 3, Paul
explains that Jesus Christ “will transform our body of humiliation to
having the same shape as his body of glory, according to the operation of
his power, to subdue all things also to himself” [^15]. An
body that can no longer die. One like his own.

In Luke 24, on the third day after Jesus was buried, some angels
they appear to the women who went to the grave and they are full of fear
they bowed to the ground, but those men said to them, “Why
What do you seek among the dead for the one who lives? [^16].

I live forever because it can no longer die!

So if I die, they revive me, I rewrite the divine comedy and then I
I die again, as probably happened to the widow's son when
Elías revives him, or the dead man who, when they are going to bury him, reaches
touching the bones of Elisha, Elijah's successor, and revives, we are not
speaking of the heelite YHWH min Sheol, of raising us from the tomb that
YHWH promises. The raising from the dead that our lord promises
It is not to live for a little while after having died and then die to
forever. No, it is for eternal life, so as not to die because it is no longer possible
To die.

#### In the sky.

Of course, the obvious question is: Well, if he's alive, where is he?

I haven't seen it. Where is Yeshua?

Where is that body that Tomás put his finger in, ate fish with
them, talked to them and interacted in the same way that he had
done before you die?

And the answer is given by the Bible in the first chapter of Acts of
The Apostles: He is in heaven. Or rather in the "shamaim", that
vault that Genesis speaks of, that vault that can be seen and that
has clouds and that in the time of Adam had waters below and waters above,
and that Elohim, or God, called it heaven. It is a physical heaven,
can see, it has clouds, it is a vault, and that in Adam's time it had
downstream and upstream.

The Bible says that after Yeshua was resurrected he appeared several times
and in one of them described in the Acts of the Apostles, while
spoke to some of his followers, and while they were
looking, Jesus was lifted up and a cloud enveloped him and they did not take him back.
watch. And while they stared at the sky, at the "shamaim", seeing how
Jesus was walking away, two men dressed in white, two angels,
appeared next to them and said: "Men
Galileans, why do you stand looking at the sky? This Jesus, who
was taken from you up into heaven, it will come in the same way as
they have seen go to heaven” [^17]. She's in heaven, and she'll be back just the same
way he climbed: physically. The same, not another person, the same
person, with the wounds on his feet and hands, with all his power and
glory, Yeshua himself announces to us in Matthew 24. He will come and reign for
thousand years from Israel.

#### For all.

This resurrection that the Bible speaks of is for everyone, for everyone
those who have lived since Adam and Eve are alive and will live. Everyone.
Good's and bad's. That is what the Bible tells us. Yeshua tells us in
John 5 that “Do not be astonished at this, for the hour will come
when ALL that are in the graves will hear his voice and come out,
who did good for the resurrection of life but those who
they practiced evil for the resurrection of” [^18] “judgment” [^19].

Paul tells us in Acts of the Apostles 24 that “I have
hope in God, which they themselves also cherish, that there will be
resurrection of the just and the unjust” [^20] and in Revelation 20
The Bible tells us that: “And the sea gave up the dead that were in it,
and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them; Y
they were judged, each one according to his works” [^21]. all the dead
they resurrect. The resurrection of the Bible is for everyone.

#### Has not happened.

The resurrection that the Bible speaks of has not happened. The dead don't go
resurrecting as they die. No, in the Bible, if you
you die, you cannot do anything, "because in Sheol, where you are going, there is no
works, or accounts, or knowledge, or wisdom” [^22], there is no memory
of God and cannot be praised or known [^23]. His body is in the
earth, in the tomb, made dust and his spirit returned to God who was
who gave it [^24], that is to say that everything returned to how it was before
to be alive. Or as our lord says: he is asleep. a dead man alone
can do those things when he ceases to be dead, when he has returned to
live, when he has risen from the grave.

YHWH heelite min Sheol. This has not happened with the exception of Yeshua and
a few others: more than five hundred, less than 144,000. A few. In
Revelation 20, the Bible tells us that these few came back to life and
reigned with Christ for a thousand years [^25], and that “the rest of the dead do not
they lived again, but not until the thousand years were finished” [^26]. One thousand
years that the day of the Lord lasts. The day of Yeshua Melekh HaMashiakh. One thousand
years in which there will be peace because Satan will be chained. In
Revelation 20 the Bible also tells us that “when the thousand
years, Satan will be released from his prison” [^27] for his destruction
total, and after that there yes: "the sea gave up the dead that
were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were
in them; and they were judged, each one according to his works” [^ 28].

Jesus explains in John 6 that: “this is the
will of the one who sent me: that I lose nothing of all that he has
given, but raise him up on the last day. This is my will
Father: that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and
may I raise him up on the last day” [^29]. Not before. the resurrection of
the vast majority is until the final day.

Paul explains in Second Timothy 2 that some have strayed from the
truth saying that our rising, our resurrection, has already had
place, and they are thus upsetting the faith of some [^30]. has not
happened. Not for the vast majority of those who have lived, are alive
and they will live.

#### Sleepy.

According to John 11 Jesus Christ affirms that: "Our friend Lazarus sleeps but
I'm going to wake him up" [^31] and then explains "Lazarus is dead" [^32].
dead, it is necessary to awaken it so that it can live again.

And according to Mark 5 and Luke 8 Yeshua affirms: "The girl is not dead, but
asleep" [^33]. And then revives her.

Jesus Christ refers to the dead as asleep. And like all
sleeping person, they have no conscience. They are asleep. asleep than he
can awaken temporarily, as in the case of Lazarus, or in a way
permanent, on the last day, when he promises to give them a body that
it cannot die, like that of Jesus Christ himself, and bring them back to life. Do not
before. The dead for Jesus Christ are actually alive but without
body and without conscience, that is why he calls them asleep. He promise
awaken them that they may know him, that they may have life and life in
abundance. While they're asleep they can't meet the never
sleeps, the Father, nor him who slept three days and three nights,
Jesus Christ, because those who are asleep are unconscious and do not speak with
awake.

The Bible affirms that, before the resurrection of the dead, the sons
of Adam who have died physically, are asleep. they can't do
nothing, they cannot know Jesus Christ and much less the Father.

#### A new land.

Another question that the Bible answers about this supposed
resurrection is: Where are those 20 to 30 billion people going to be?
people who would be resurrected?

In the sky?

No. In Revelation 21, John tells us that it will be on a new earth with a
new sky [^34]. Apparently without seas, without sun and without moon [^35],
but right here on this very planet. A land where God lives with
men in a city that comes down from heaven and that John calls the new
Jerusalem. And that the nations will walk in the light of that city, and that
the kings of the world will give him their riches [^36]. John says that he
throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in the city and his servants
they will adore him, they will see him face to face and they will carry his name on their foreheads. Over there
there will be no night and those who live there will not need lamplight or light
of sun because God, the Lord, will give them his light and they will reign for all
the centuries [^37].

John claims to hear a loud voice coming from the throne and saying: "here is
the place where God lives with men. He will live with them and they will be
their peoples and God himself will be with them as their God. He will dry all
tears from them and there will be no death, no crying, no pain because everything
what used to exist has ceased to exist” [^38].

It is not in heaven. It is in a new earth with a new sky. Is not that
the resurrected ascend to heaven, but God descends to a new earth to
live among men.

#### Basis of Faith.

This resurrection that the Bible describes to us, which is physical, in which
you can't die, it's for everyone, it hasn't happened, it's in this
same planet, is the basis of faith in Yeshua. unfortunately for
some like Hitler, Pablo Escobar, or Stalin, had to wait until
the raising of the dead to be able to believe in the raising of the
dead. And by the grace of YHWH for others who already believe in the
resurrection that the Bible speaks of, the process of entering the Kingdom of
God, to the Kingdom of Heaven, it has already begun.

That Kingdom of Heaven that our Lord speaks: It is already among you and
in you, but no one can say here it is or there it is because
It can be seen. That Kingdom of eternal life, of Absolute Truth, of Freedom
of Sin, Salvation from death, Divine Justice in hearts,
of indescribable Joy, of Kindness, of Joy, of total delivery and without
conditions, of Forgiveness, of Mercy, of True Love, of Peace
inexhaustible, of the Peace of the Lord, in YHWH, in Yeshua, in the Ruakh
HaKodesh. A True and eternal Peace.

That Kingdom of Heaven is already among you.

#### Possible.

The answer to the question Is the resurrection described in the
Bible? It is obvious if we only take into account these fundamental aspects:
which is physical, in which one cannot die, which is for everyone, which has not
happened, which is on this very planet. This resurrection is imagined
in futuristic movies as a real possibility. However, the
resurrection described in the bible has additional characteristics:

Yeshua, according to Mark 12, tells us that we will be like the angels in heaven
[^39], and these, according to 1 Chronicles 21, can float between heaven and earth
earth [^40]. Similar to how Yeshua himself rose into the sky,
after resurrected, according to Acts 1 [^41].

Furthermore, Yeshua himself, according to Luke 24 and John 20, appears in the midst
of the apostles, these being behind closed doors [^42], something similar to
the teleportation that science fiction movies show us.
Thus, a resurrected person does not need to walk to go from one place to another.

They can also become invisible to some eyes and at the same time visible
to other eyes as happened to Balaam and his donkey [^43] in Numbers 22 or
as happened to Elisha and his servant [^44] in 2nd Kings 6.

And according to 1 Corinthians 6, the body of a resurrected one will not need to eat
to keep running [^45]. Apparently it will be something optional,
because our lord ate grilled fish after he was resurrected [^46].
Something very convenient that would leave plenty of free space for all those
resurrected, in that new earth with a new sky, because it will not be
necessary to cultivate something that is just a taste and not a necessity.

And if the body of the resurrected is like that of the angels, it will be resistant
to physical fire. In Daniel 3 an angel protects Ananias, Misael and
Azariah [^47], and in Judges 13 an angel stands above the fire when
announces the birth of Samson [^48].

Thus, the answer to the question Is the resurrection described in
the Bible? includes aspects that are more complicated to project to a
future with technologies that most people can use in
day to day But, if the bible is true, in the future every person
will have access to the explanation of these other aspects of the
resurrection because the bible assures that "there is nothing hidden that
be discovered, nor anything secret that will not be known and
clear up" [^49].

Perhaps this is why Our Lord Yeshua, according to John 6, assures that
“No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me” [^50] “he
drag first” [^51].

So if the bible is true, no one, absolutely no one, after
resurrected, you will be able to answer "NO" to the question:

Is the resurrection described in the bible possible?

### The fabric.

To the image found on the piece of cloth known as The Mantle
of Turin have made technical studies of spectroscopy, thermography and
infrared photography, ultra-violet photography, spectroscopy
fluorescent, x-ray radiography, transmitted light photography and
reflected light, optical and atomic resolution microscopy with
electron microscopes and x-ray scanning microscopes,
carbon-14, biological studies of pollen, of blood, studies
criminalistic, forensic, artistic, cultural and many others. In
summary is the most studied piece of cloth with all the techniques and
technologies known to man and has been found to present
some features that make it different from any other image
known to man.

#### A negative.

The image of the body on the mantle of Turin is the only color image
inverted or pre-1800 "photographic negative" known by the
men. This was only evident until photography was invented in
1800 and years later Secondo Pia takes a photograph of him in 1898.
observe the negative of the photograph was observed the positive of the
image on the mantle. There is a historical record of the Turin mantle from 1357
when it was exhibited in Lirey France. If photography was invented in
1800 and there is no negative image of person, animal or thing,
before 1800, with the exception of the Turin Mantle and its copies
artistic, who made the mantle of Turin?

#### Photographic realism.

The degree of detail in the anatomical proportions of the human figure
of the mantle is photo-realistic and the amount of information per
image area on the mantle is greater than any photograph made
with a modern 15 megapixel cell phone. Thus, the mantle presents
photographic characteristics and quality but it is not a photograph. Do not
There is no image prior to the invention of photography with this
level of realism and detail. So who made the Turin mantle?

#### Oxidized microfibers.

The material of the mantle where the image of the body is found is
linen. One of the main components of flax is cellulose. The
threads of the fabric that forms the mantle have thousands of microfibers. A
Microfiber is thinner than a human hair. The image of the body
The mantle is formed on the surface of the outer microfibers of
the mantle threads and only in the parts where said microfibers are
external to the thread they form. If the microfiber penetrates the thread, in said
part is not modified. They are very small dehydrations, oxidations
or "aging" of the surface cellulose that makes up the
mantle microfibers, which form the image of the body on the mantle.
Thus, the image of the body is part of the mantle, of the microfibers of the
mantle. There is no pigment in the microfibers. and there is only
modifications where there is no blood. There are no modifications below the
blood. The image of the body is posterior to the blood. It is as if with a
laser would have modified, burned, the microfibers, aging
nanometric parts of each microfiber, burning the surface of each
microfiber Modifications have no directionality so each
modification is independent of each other. The image is very
surface and constitutive part of the microfibers of the threads that
form the mantle. This is why the image has not moved, shifted or
distorted neither by fire nor by water to which the
mantle. This is also why, as the mantle has aged, the
image to lost contrast, but no information about the image of the
body. There is no image of person, animal or thing, prior to the
year 1978, apart from the Turin mantle, with this characteristic. And then
from 1978 just some attempts to reproduce an image like the mantle
They claim to have this characteristic. There is not and has not been
man-made image exhibiting this feature. Not even
it was known that the mantle had this characteristic before 1978. Thus
Who made the mantle of Turin?

#### Topographic information.

When analyzing the image of the body in the mantle of Turin,
observes a correlation between image density and distance from the body
to the fabric. At a greater distance, the image is clearer, and at a smaller
distance to the canvas, the image is darker. This allows you to create
computer images that have three-dimensional characteristics.
Thus, the mantle has holographic characteristics but is not a
hologram. The level of detail in the bony features of the image
it is comparable in some parts to an x-ray. Thus, the mantle also
it has radiographic features but is not an x-ray. Do not
There is no image of a person, animal or thing, prior to the year 1978,
apart from the Turin mantle, with this characteristic. And after 1978
only some attempts to reproduce an image like the mantle allege
present this characteristic. No photograph taken with a
cellular, neither before nor after 1978 presents this characteristic. Neither
it was not even known that the mantle had this characteristic before
1978. So who made the Turin mantle?

#### Ultraviolet light.

The separation of blood in the serous phase from blood in the
corpuscular only occurs at the time of death. blood serum and
other substances in human blood are invisible to the human eye but
visible under ultra-violent light, these techniques are used in the
modern crime investigation. The mantle presents this type of
separation in the flank wound. If this kind of evidence was only
perceivable until the invention of modern light forensic techniques
ultra-violet and the mantle is before 1900, who before 1900 had the
careful to separate the two phases in the bloodstain on the side and
thus differentiate it from the other ante-mortem wounds in an analysis
forensics that was only possible until the 20th century? who made the cloak
Turin?

#### Bilirubin.

In cases of violent death, hemoglobin production is very high.
when it breaks down one of the products is bilirubin. The
mantle blood remains red due to high rates of
bilirubin in the blood. This forensic information was only known
until the 20th century, so the body that was in contact with the mantle of
Turin suffered a violent death, because no one before the 20th century could
falsify a detail that I did not know I should falsify: that the blood for
violent death presents high levels of bilirubin. so who
made the mantle of Turin?

#### Forensic details.

There are multiple forensic details that are present on the mantle of
Turin and which are consistent with modern forensic science and a death
by crucifixion as described in the gospels: the inflammation
belly, thumb up, high levels of bilirubin
in blood, blood phase separation in post-mortem wounds,
small subcutaneous hemorrhages or hematohidrosis, the position
body with rigor-mortis, the threads of blood on the face and arms
consistent with a crucifixion, the wound to the side, the wounds of
feet and hands from a Roman crucifixion, head wounds
consistent with a thorny helmet exclusive to the execution of
Christ, the wounds throughout the body consistent with whipping with
Roman flagrum, the dislocated shoulder, the portion of beard torn off, the
bruises on the face, the various types of pollen from the Jerusalem area
in times of spring consistent with the helmet of thorns, the
flowers, oils and ointments from a burial of a wealthy Jew
like Joseph of Arimathea, and many others. That is, the mantle presents
all the evidence of someone who died just as Jesus Christ died
of the gospels. There is no other piece of cloth in the whole
history of humanity, apart from the mantle of Turin, with all the
forensic and forensic evidence consistent with the death
of Jesus described in the gospel, even if some of this evidence
was completely invalid or unacceptable. So who made the cloak
from Turin?

#### Views.

There is no reproduction of the Turin mantle that even meets
with a tenth of the characteristics that the mantle of
Turin. Perhaps the most complete (whole body) and thorough attempt
(trying to imitate the characteristics that were known in 1978) has
been that of Garlaschelli in 2010. This attempt could not overcome
resolution, pigmentation, thermal stability and
ultra-violet analysis that has overcome the mantle. That not to mention
all the forensic details that the cloak presents. The truth is that today
with today's technology, year 2022, counted from the approximate year
of the birth of Jesus Christ, of the king of kings, of the Meshiakh of YHWH, the
man has not been able to produce a fabric with the characteristics of the mantle
from Turin. And even if he could do it, even if he could reproduce in a
future: where, in what part of the world, where is an image of
person, animal or thing, with verifiable historical record, prior to
1800, when photography was invented, let it be a photographic negative,
with photographic realism in its anatomical details? And that for not
ask about its holographic, radiographic characteristics and all the
forensic evidence only known and verifiable until the 20th century that was
find the mantle. Where? Negative? From when? With historical record
ascertainable? With photo realism? Does not exist. It does not exist, nor has
existed in the world another linen mantle that presents the characteristics
of the Turin mantle. Spot. So if the Turin mantle was not made by
man, who made the mantle of Turin? Could it be that he did it the same as
Do you have enough technical creativity to reconstruct a human being? The
creator? Because all the evidence indicates there can't be.
made the human.

### Last.

#### Methods.

To determine the past the human being has developed a method. It is
Similar to judicial systems. For each event, the
historical sources, whether physical or narrative, determines who,
when, how, where, why of the source. The credibility of the
the source and then the historical sources are crossed to try to
establish the matches, analyze the sources and try to
establish the best explanation of the past.

The sources of the recent past have been made a little more credible with the
possibility of man to record audio and video and easily spread it
using the internet. And since the 15th century, with the invention of the printing press,
the dissemination of the written medium has been much easier.

Thus, the method for determining the past has benefited from the
technical creativity of man, but this only affects the ability to
determine the recent past. Sources for the past before the
15th century are rarer.

#### Matches.

When a person wants to search for information on the Internet, he chooses a
set of words that are most specific to the information
Looking For. If I search only for "Jose" I will not find the page
of the person I am looking for, but if I search for 4 words “Jose
Luis Quiroga github” I will find exactly the page that I am
searching despite the immense amount of information that is in
Internet.

With only 3 or 4 words that identify what I am looking for, which in
set are unique, exclusive, of the information I am looking for,
I will find the information. That set of words begins to
function as a key for the containing page at 3 or 4
words.

It is the power of coincidences. Despite the vast amount of
information on the Internet, it is possible to find a page
specify with only 3 or 4 words that are mandatory and
exclusive to that page.

In judicial processes, when evidence is analyzed, a
similar process to try to establish the truth of an event of the
last. Most processes are decided based on evidence
circumstantial, that is, by coincidence it favors or disfavors the
accused. When the coincidences are too many in one way or another it is
easy to make a decision. Each match decreases exponentially
the statistical probability of an event other than the one
coincidence supports. The effect of cumulative matches is of type
exponential.

You can have different criteria to decide if something did happen, or
did not happen, based solely on coincidence. This is the criteria of
"preponderance" which is when the balance of coincidences is greater
to one of the two options. Other criteria may be that of “clear and
convincing” and “without reasonable doubt”. They all involve a level
of certainty as to whether something really did happen or did not happen. But
all of these imply only "believing" something. Regarding the past, no.
we can be absolutely certain of anything.

In a similar way to how a judicial system seeks to establish the
veracity of a past event, historians have a method that is
supports matches to establish whether an event happened or not.

In the case of history the events are generated by human beings. Y
it is precisely that exponential effect of the accumulation of coincidences,
and its logical analysis, which allows us to decide where to go.
tips the scales of what is possible, of what is feasible, of the best
rational explanation. Decide what I am going to believe regarding that possible
and credible past.

Yet another reason to say that since we cannot travel to the past, or see,
or listen to the past, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be certain of said past.
Even our own past may not be exactly as
we remember

Although the sources of the recent past are more credible than the
from the distant past, we can only BELIEVE the past.

#### Persons.

In the previous examples, the one of pages in Internet, the one of events
judicial or historical, it is very important to bear in mind that the
events were generated by human beings, by intelligent beings with
capacity of decision, with will.

People wrote those pages on the Internet, people did or didn't
the events of the past. This kind of approach to the "probable"
“possible” is very different from assuming that the events were
randomly generated.

Chance has no intelligence, no capacity for decision, no will,
no intention. Chance does not lie, it does not deceive, it has no interests
or personal needs or desires.

I make this comment for when I refer to some religions based on
in events generated by chance, by the hump, passing through
"sciences".

The reason is very simple, a machine that is good for something does not work
by hump, nor by chance. There is always a mechanism, a design, a logic.
That's why there is no mathematical function that generates numbers
completely random. A computer cannot generate a sequence
completely random of ones or zeros. The program does not exist. not it
I searched. You waste your time.

But there are religions that believe so. And they pass that I dial for science.

Fortunately, the story is about people.

#### Assuming.

Mr. Alegre has a large family and several pets.

Mr. Cheerful enters the bathroom and finds that the sink faucet
is leaking, the drain is blocked and the sink is running
filling.

Mr. Alegre has a high-tech instrument that
lets you know how much water is in a container just by pointing at it
bowl. And you can take the measurement every microsecond.

Mr. Cheerful wants to know how long the faucet has been leaking
of his sink and reasons as follows:

Assuming the sink was empty when the faucet was turned off.

Assuming all the water in the sink comes from the faucet.

Assuming that since the key was closed the car has not been unlocked.
drain.

Assuming that no one has manipulated the key to open or close it anymore
than it is right now.

So with the high-tech instrument, Mr. Alegre can
measure at what rate the sink is filling because in one second
reaches a million times the amount of water in the sink and
then you can calculate how long the faucet has been leaking.

Anyone can see that Mr. Cheerful's problem is not
is in your high-tech instrument, nor in the technology that is
used to build the instrument.

The problem is in Mr. Alegre's assumptions.

There is no guarantee that one of your children will not flush the sink, or
that two of them were playing paper boat, or that the cat or
one of his pets opened the faucet a little when he touched it in passing and that
None of your assumptions hold.

This and other problems have some accepted procedures such as
scientists but who are actually pseudo-scientists, that is, ALMOST
scientists. At least high technology is used.

For the moment I give this example to make it clear that the call
radiometric dating, permanently associated with the word
"science", the word "certainty" and the word "we know", should be
completely abandoned as ABSURD and useless. This technique that
supposedly used to determine the age of rocks and other objects
based on the measurement of radioactive elements, does EXACTLY the
Same assumptions as Mr. Alegre.

For any supposed radiometric dating, we start from the following
assumptions:

Assuming the initial conditions are known.

Assuming that there are no external effects that alter the conditions of
the chemical elements measured.

Assuming that the rate of change, of radioactivity, of the
measured chemical elements has been maintained.

Then I can calculate when these rocks or objects were formed.
contain such radioactive elements.

The same force that made Nazism popular in Germany makes a
Most consider radiometric dating as evidence. Is not the
the only case in which absurd methods are supported by instruments of high
technology to give them credibility, but it is the most ABSURD of all
when it comes to determining the past.

We can only believe the past.

The statistical fact that radiometric dates are ignored
when they do not give the expected result, it is just a confirmation that
the method is absurd.

Dating by radioactive elements is one of the most absurd ways
of using high technology to obtain completely useless results
because it assumes too many things impossible to verify.

In historical methods it is better to use synchronic dating, two
events recorded in writing that are related to each other. Without
However, such dates are determined by person records.
People who may lie, cheat and have ulterior motives, or
just be wrong. It is the logical analysis of historical sources
which allows establishing the greater or lesser degree of credibility of each
particular data. And it is in this logical analysis where the coincidences
and synchronies play a very important role.

#### Verbatim.

One of the main historical sources are the type sources
narrative. The human being decides to write texts that narrate what is
happening, or what you think has happened, or what you want in a
future think it happened, and write a record of it.

Among these texts that claim to record history there are some
quite old:

Herodotus lived in 400 BC. The 8 oldest copies that
we have of his writings are from 900 after Christ, about 1300 years
after he wrote them.

Thucydides also lived in 400 BC. The 8 more copies
oldest we have of his writings are also from 900 after
Christ, also some 1,300 years after he wrote them.

Caesar lived in 50 BC. The 10 oldest copies that
we have of his writings are also from 900 after Christ, about 950
years after he wrote them.

Livy, lived in 1 BC. The 19 complete copies plus
oldest we have of his writings are from about 1000 years after
who wrote them.

Tacitus, The 20 oldest copies we have of your writings are from
some 1000 years after he wrote them.

Suetonius. The 8 oldest copies we have of his writings are from
some 800 years after he wrote them.

Pliny the Younger. The 7 oldest copies we have of his writings
they are about 700 years after he wrote them.

Flavius ​​Josephus. The few oldest incomplete copies we have of
his writings are about 1000 years after he wrote them.

There is only one set of narratives, which are written with the objective
of registering certain events, which stands out above all other
narratives never written by man: those we find in new
will.

Of the new testament there are about 6000 manuscripts from 100 years to
150 years after writing. All its authors were alive when
events transpired, all eyewitnesses with the exception of
Luke and the author of the letter to the Hebrews.

They were all alive when the events took place. Everyone. Matthew, Mark,
Luke, John, Paul, Peter, Jacob, Jude. Everyone.

Matthew, Mark, John, Peter, Jacob and Jude were disciples of
Jesus Christ. They ate with him, walked with him, talked with him afterwards
of resurrected.

But no. There are people who want to confirm everything with other sources that
are not in the bible, those of which there are almost no copies and are from
thousands of years after the events. And since you can't, they believe that everything
It must be a lie.

If the new testament is not a valid historical source, NO narration,
absolutely no other pre-print text is source
valid history. Assuming that the new testament is not a historical source
valid is just absurd. This is not how the human being establishes
historical facts.

#### On the cross.

Jesus Christ died on the cross.

There is no fact of ancient history that has more
corroboration, acceptance, disclosure and evidence that the death of
Jesus Christ on the cross. If you do not accept that Jesus Christ died
crucified should actually believe absolutely nothing of the
history prior to the year fifteen hundred after Christ.

People die, people get killed, the Romans crucified people,
many wrote of the matter, they had no reason to lie. Easy to
believe.

However, there is no lack of Muslims who, because their imam, their religious leader,
He told him that the book called Koran, one that the boss claims to know,
possibly, according to statistics, without knowing how to read Arabic, a book that
must be different from the one that, according to the same Muslim records,
dictated the slaver of blacks [^52] whiter than milk [^53] that
had sexual relations with a 9-year-old girl [^54], because, according to
those records, a goat ate part of what he dictated [^55] and, according to
those records, a Muslim leader decided to burn all the Korans
different from what he wanted the original to be [^56], that this book,
says that in reality Jesus Christ did not die on the cross but was taken
to heaven alive without having died, then no, he did NOT die on the cross, and
clever.

However, all the historical evidence, far more than there is to
any other event of antiquity, indicates the opposite.

Jesus Christ died on the cross. Historical fact. More than any other of the
old history. More than the simple existence of Alexander the Great,
Julius Caesar and Muhammad.

#### They believed.

The believer believes that Jesus Christ was physically resurrected.

The first people who believed in the resurrection of Christ, was
because they saw him, touched him, ate with him, talked with him and
they put their finger He remembered them and they remembered him.

That's what they said, that's what they wrote, and they all kept that
belief until his death. Most killed JUST for believing
precisely that: that he had risen.

That was what they believed. They had talked, touched and eaten with a
physical Jesus who was the same one they had seen dead on the cross and who
they had buried.

Most historians, scholars, and people who study the
older manuscripts accept that this was the belief of those
early christians.

To this day that is the belief of anyone calling themselves
Christian. That Jesus Christ was resurrected in body and spirit. The one who doesn't believe
that Jesus Christ rose, is not a BELIEVER in Jesus Christ. Believe
Jesus Christ Risen is the basis of faith in Jesus Christ.

Many were persecuted for what they believed. many died for it
what they believed

But there is no shortage of those who say no, that this was not what they believed. Although
all the evidence indicates that this was what they believed and not only that
but that is precisely the DEFINITION of a believer, of a
CHRISTIAN.

The direct witnesses died believing that Jesus Christ is alive because
resurrected

The believer believes that Jesus Christ was physically resurrected. Historical fact.

#### Followers.

The follower wants to be like Jesus Christ, he wants to live, die and rise again
like Jesus Christ.

Those who went out to travel the world, to tell what they had lived,
seen and experienced firsthand, those who were persecuted by
believe what they believed for their own countrymen, those of whom
many died for what they believed, those who were in jail, or
were flogged, or stoned, or burned, or crucified, or
beheaded, or hanged, or boiled in OIL for believing what they believed:
that Jesus Christ had risen and therefore they had nothing to
fear of physical death because Jesus Christ would physically resurrect them
to them also as he had promised before he died on the cross
; those believers were not always so brave, nor so communicative,
neither so travelers, nor so followers of Jesus Christ.

Before the apparitions that they say they had, they hid, they did not
They moved, they denied him, they ran away when they came to arrest him.
Even when they see it for the first time, when they touch it for the first time,
They are scared, they can't believe it. It's the guy's turn to ask for a piece of
grilled fish and eat it in front of them. And one that was not in that
moment, do not believe it. They tell him but he doesn't believe. only until
he puts his finger on it, he thinks. They were not the same before as after
appearances.

Afterwards, they are no longer afraid to die. They are no longer afraid of what they will say. Already
not afraid of persecution. They are no longer afraid of what they can
make them men. And they suffer the consequences.

For the vast majority of Jews of Yeshua's time, believing in a
Meshiakh crucified was unheard of. It was an offense. die on a tree
it was curse. The Messiah was someone who would physically reign from
Israel above all people, language and nation. that would bring peace to the world
whole. Furthermore, the resurrection of the dead was an event at the end of
the times and for ALL Israelites. It was not a one-time event.
individual. That was not what most Jews believed. Those
beliefs generated a rejection, a contempt, on the part of that majority
of Israelites, towards the FEW Israelites who DID believe that Jesus Christ
he was the Meshiakh and that he had risen.

Shaul of Tarsus was one of those Jews. He despised and persecuted those
who believed in a Meshiakh like that. Later he would be known as Pablo,
the Apostle, because he changed. After an appearance, a little different to
that of the previous apostles changed. He began to believe the testimony of
the apostles, goes and meets with them in Jerusalem, to find out well
how was the matter. You are going to investigate, find out, confirm, make
“historicized” Peter, a Greek word from which the word
"history".

He also changed. He went from being a persecutor to being persecuted.

Because after losing EVERYTHING: fame, wealth, power, since he was a
A high-ranking Pharisee in the Temple, well educated and from a good family,
in charge of the military part of the temple and the important task of
put an end to that hand of Jews who claimed to believe in a crucified Messiah
and that it is said that he had risen; After starting to believe in what
they believed that hand of the Jews, it was their turn to leave everything, lose EVERYTHING. And the,
Pablo, referred to everything that he had had to abandon as "GARBAGE"
if you compared it to being a follower of Jesus Christ.

And after shipwrecks, being stoned, being flogged multiple times,
of being imprisoned several times, of assassination attempts, of
conspiracies against him, dies BEHEADED precisely for believing what
believe.

He also changed.

Even today, every Christian is seen to have changed, at least in his
behavior with respect to sin, to that which is bad in the eyes of that
Jesus Christ who says follow. A Christian, if he truly believes
what he claims to believe, he must take care of what he says, what he thinks and what he does.
All of this must bear witness to what it claims to believe. must live as
Jesus Christ lived.

The first Christians wanted to follow Jesus Christ, that is, they wanted
live, die and rise as Jesus Christ. That only happened after
truly believe that Jesus Christ had risen.

The follower wants to be like Jesus Christ, he wants to live, die and rise again
like Jesus Christ. Historical fact.

#### Dead.

The Christian leader dies executed during the first centuries.

Starting with the first leader. Jesus Christ is condemned by the Board
Supreme of the Jewish priests, elders and teachers, to a death in
the cross for answering "You say that I am" to the
asks “Then you are the Son of God?”[^57].

Paul, Peter, James and the first leaders are executed for believing
that Jesus Christ is King, that he is the Meshiakh of Israel, the son of God.
They die without resisting. They die without being violent. die
following their leader, obeying their King who commands them to love their
enemies, forgive them and pray for those who persecute them. die following
to the one they believe is alive and is going to return.

After the destruction of the second Temple and taking of Jerusalem in the
70 after Christ the persecution begins to become systematic by
part of the Roman empire. The reluctance to make public sacrifices to
Roman emperor, as if he were God, or any other false god
Roman was enough evidence for a Christian, a follower of
Jesus Christ, who of course refused to worship anything that he did not
was the only true God, was sentenced to death. He normally he was
interrogated and, if he admitted to being a Christian, he was sentenced to death. Do not
It didn't matter if he was Jewish or not. If he was a follower of Jesus Christ and
they considered that Jesus Christ had a superior authority to the emperor,
said follower was a threat to the empire.

During these early centuries, being a Christian could mean suffering a
violent death. Obviously the main objectives of the Roman Empire
were the most influential, the Christian leaders.

A follower of Jesus Christ, a Christian, is one because he follows the orders
of their leader. That leader died without offering resistance, without opening his mouth,
like a lamb to the slaughter. That leader dies sparing his executors.
That leader dies doing what he orders his followers to do: love
their enemies and pray and plead for those who persecute them.

According to Acts 7, Stephen, the first follower killed for being a follower
of Jesus Christ, dies doing the same thing his leader did, praying for his
assassins.

The persecution to death by the Roman Empire begins to stop
at the beginning of the 4th century when most of the growth of followers
is starting to happen among people who can read Greek, those who
can read the new testament, those same people who belong to the
empire.

There is a division among those who think that a purge of the
believers and those who think that the movement should be integrated into the empire
because it does not represent a threat to the Roman empire. The Empire
ends up under the rule of an emperor who knew how to befriend the
who believed in integration to win the decisive battle.

The Christian leader is systematically executed during the first
centuries. Historical fact.

#### Growth.

Given the above logical and historical facts:

1. Jesus Christ died on the cross.
2. The believer believes that Jesus Christ was physically resurrected.
3. The follower wants to be like Jesus Christ, wants to live, die and
    resurrect as Jesus Christ.
4. The Christian leader dies executed during the first centuries.

We have to: Explain the growth of the number of followers of
Jesus Christ in the first centuries is easier believing that Jesus Christ
is alive than believing that Jesus Christ is dead.

The only social movement in the entire history of mankind that has
grown since its inception with the systematic elimination of its leaders,
without these or their followers putting up violent resistance, leaders
executed by the dominant system for the sole fact of believing that a
dead rose to confirm his kingship, has been Christianity.

Since the punishment for being a believer was death, the only
rational explanation, is that the believer actually believed that after
from dead he was also going to resurrect, that he was also going to live again,
just as his leader did and that he promises will happen to the
follower.

For the first followers of Jesus Christ to be able to
obey their leader, who commanded them to love their enemies and those whom
persecute them, to the point of violent death and without responding
with violence, the only possible explanation is that these first
followers really believed that Jesus Christ is alive.

And for the death of a leader to INCREASE the number of believers,
needs that those who did not believe before the death of the leader, those
future believers, those new believers, will observe, experience
something that would make them believe that the dead leader was not only convinced
that he would be resurrected, but that they ALSO watch,
experienced something that made them believe that THEYSELF also
they would be resurrected.

If I believe that the leader died believing something false, if I don't have something
concrete, an experience, something logical, rational, that I consider real
and trustworthy for ME ALSO, that I too am going to resurrect, is going to be
impossible for me to be willing to die for the sole fact that the
leader was willing to die for something he believed to be true, or that
even I think it was true for him, but not for me too.

If I only believe "poor chiflis was good people, it's a shame they killed him",
or “how good FOR THE ONE who will be resurrected, but I am not going to be
resurrected”, then I will not be willing to die the same
way. The movement could not GROW, INCREASE.

The movement grew because those who died really believed that they were going to die.
resurrect and those who did not believe before the death of the leader, later, in
At some point, they experienced something MORE than the simple death of a leader.
believed something possibly false, and they ALSO began to believe that
they would be resurrected. Otherwise they would not have been willing to die
for what they believed without resisting.

Those new believers had to be experiencing, living something that
confirmed them experimentally, something reliable enough,
enough to believe that the leader believed something true, something true that
it is also for a new believer. That Jesus Christ, the first executed,
is alive, that the dead leader will also be resurrected, and that the new
believer will also be resurrected.

If Jesus Christ is dead, to explain the GROWTH of the
Christianity in the first centuries, it is required to resort to believing that
all the followers of Jesus Christ, all those early followers who
they died believing what they believed, without opening their mouths, without opposing
violent resistance, loving their enemies, praying for them,
they were just CRAZY. And that all current believers
they are also just as crazy for believing in such an absurdity. Is required
assume that no authentic follower of Jesus Christ, the one who really
believes that Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected, and wants, and tries, to
live as Jesus Christ teaches us, has rational capacity. that all the
Christianity, the authentic one, the one that really obeys its leader and is
willing to die without offering resistance, that one who loves the enemy, that
who forgives his murderer, the one who is going to kill him, the one who does it alone
because he really believes that he is going to resurrect, the one who was born and grew up in his
first centuries at the point of dead leaders, without resisting, this
composed of a list of LOCOS that includes their first leader,
Jesus Christ. Believing that is harder than believing that Jesus Christ is alive.
because he was resurrected.

It is much easier to consider the possibility that actually
Jesus Christ rose, he is alive, they saw him, they touched him, they ate fish
with him, they continued to experience signs, wonders and wonders, which
They confirmed that he is alive, that his promises are true, that we are going to
resurrect, that we will live eternally, that his spirit lives in the
believer, that the same spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead
lives in the believer, and that is the real reason why they are
willing to die loving, forgiving and praying for the one who is going to
to kill.

It is easier to consider the possibility that the movement is not just
"social", but it is also from God. A movement of Sons of God
alive, from the Creator of heaven and earth, from the creator of these bodies
in which we live and therefore can remake them, can
rebuild. That she can RESURRECT us as she did with her son
Jesus Christ.


HOME_SCRIPT
### Credibility.

We don't see people resurrected. The buried bodies
decompose and the cremated are left in dust. the dead are made
dust in the grave, in the grave. That is what we observe.

And if Jesus Christ was NOT resurrected, if he is not alive because he was resurrected, then
then the little book called the bible has to be thrown in the trash. All the
bible would be false because everything points to that Meshiakh of Israel. the same
Paul acknowledges this in 1 Corinthians 15 when he says that "if Christ
risen, then our preaching is in vain, your preaching is also in vain.
faith” [^58].

#### Denial.

If we deny the logical:

If we deny that:

If we are going to call the human being intelligent, designer and creative, for
all planes, shoes, cell phones, cars, all over the
technology, which has built,

We have to:

To admit, by logical necessity, that the complexity of the machinery
that we observe in plants and animals requires a technology of
someone much more intelligent, designer and creative than being
human. A creator.

Because:

Despite our intelligence, designs and creativity we cannot even
even build a cell. The minimum part of the machinery
biological and we have no idea how to do it.

If we deny that which is logical,

Well, it is practically impossible to understand the historical fact that the
direct witnesses died believing that Jesus Christ is alive because
resurrected

BUT if we take into account that:

1. By LOGIC and by all the evidence that we observe in the machinery
    biologically, in plants, animals and people, there HAS to be a
    creator of all this machinery.
2. That the gospel accounts of the crucifixion are
    backed by circumstantial evidence unique in all of history
    of humanity: the cloth in Turin. Fabric that marks a unique event,
    not generated by man, about a single person, in the whole
    history of humanity and whose characteristics coincide so
    extraordinary with the description in the gospels of the
    crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
3. That for the CREATOR of the human biological machinery it is
    perfectly possible to reproduce at will a living human body,
    with the memory, the thoughts, the exact spirit, at the moment of
    previous destruction.
4. And that the TESTIMONY of said resurrection is supported by the
    same witnesses who testify to the death of Jesus Christ in the
    cruz, the event most supported by reliable sources in the entire
    ancient history of mankind.

Thus, it is much easier to believe that those direct WITNESSES, those who say
who touched him, ate and talked with him, died believing that
Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected.

So, from now on we will try to understand the events
extraordinary narrated in the bible in the light of current technology and
of what we can logically project into the future. and not in the light
of the technology we believe the biblical authors had. is it
logical. It is a better approximation to the technological creativity of the
CREATOR.

That is to say, with more RESPECT for the biblical narratives. WITH MORE
I RESPECT. IS IT CLEAR?

#### Observations.

In addition, there are several logical observations that argue against the
falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection of
Jesus Christ, against being a fabrication of man.

Let's see:

##### Sources.

The differences in details between the sources is an argument against
the falsity of the gospels.

When several sources are exactly the same, it is possible to suspect that
these sources agreed. In court proceedings
this phenomenon is called “collusion”.

It is normal and to be expected that there will be small differences in the details
between different sources, and that are essentially the same.

In the 4 gospels it is observed just that: essentially they are
the same, although there are differences in details.

##### Knowledge.

All the information in the gospels of names, places, economy,
politics, chronology, topography, geography indicates direct knowledge
by the authors. This fact is an argument against the
falsity of the gospels.

The writings that are currently known as apocryphal, such as
the so-called gospels of Thomas and Peter, are easily
identifiable as false because they do not show knowledge or
time, place, politics, or economy consistent with the
alleged authors. They do not provide any information regarding the
topographical, economic, political, geographical conditions. They do not give
names of people or places that indicate knowledge of what
was happening around the supposed author.

The gospels show an extraordinary coherence, much greater than
any other text from the first millennium after Jesus Christ, in all
those details. This only happens with texts written by people who
they lived what they wrote and that they wrote it when the memories
they were clear.

##### Interdependent.

The 4 gospels have an abundant number of events in which the
Details complement and support each other. So in 1
gospel the details of an event are inexplicable without the
details provided by other gospels. This fact is argued in
against the falsity of the gospels.

An example is the case of Bethsaida. The only verse in all of Matthew in
that Bethsaida is mentioned is in Matthew 11 and names it as a place
where great signs have been wrought. In John 1 and 12 it is only mentioned
Bethsaida in two verses to indicate that some disciples, among
they Philip, were from that city. And, by a literal reading of Mark
6, the wonder of feeding 5000 families with 5 loaves and 2 fish happens
before Jesus Christ and his disciples arrive at Bethsaida. According to
Mark 6, once the multitude is fed, Jesus sends his disciples on
boat to cross the lake to reach Bethsaida while he bids farewell to the
crowd that had come from various cities and he catches up with them at the end
at night in the middle of the lake. And, by a literal reading of Luke 9, the
event takes place on the outskirts of Bethsaida. Only together can we
understand that Jesus and his disciples left Bethsaida because he had
a lot of congestion of people coming and going and the reason why
Jesus asks Philip, according to John 6, where he could buy bread
to feed the 5,000 families: Philip was from Bethsaida. and only with
John 6, which informs us that it was close to Passover time,
understand why, according to Mark 6, there was such a congestion of people
coming and going and the inadvertently mentioned detail that the
event happened on green grass. Jewish Passover is in spring and
all the men of Israel must go up to Jerusalem.

The gospels are interdependent: they support and complement each other.
others. Each match exponentially decreases the probability
statistics that these are planned by the authors. This type of
Internal evidence is cumulative exponentially.

##### Alive.

The fact that the 4 evangelists were alive when the events took place
is an argument against the falsity of the biblical testimonies about
the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Myths and legends are generated with centuries of difference between the
moment in which the events take place and the authors of the narrations.

The fact that the perpetrators were alive when the events took place
it is a very strong argument against it being a legend or a myth.

From the very day the witnesses spoke, ate and touched the
The Risen Jesus Christ began to spread the story.

Myths and legends begin centuries after the events.

##### Jerusalem.

The spread of the testimony beginning in Jerusalem is an argument in
against the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection
of Jesus Christ.

The myths and legends, as well as the false narratives of the ancient world,
they do not start on the scene. They start where hardly anyone or
no one can testify against due to lack of information.

The resurrection story begins on the scene:
It begins in Jerusalem.

##### Equal.

That the testimonies we have today are equal to the manuscripts
oldest is an argument against the falsity of the testimonies
Biblical accounts of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

The testimony has been the same from the beginning: Jesus Christ is alive
because he rose on the third day.

On the third day after his death, early in the morning, some women went to
the tomb and found it empty. Some angels tell them to go to
tell that the dead has risen and is alive. They, out of fear,
they decide not to tell anyone except the apostles. Mary Magdalene and
others meet Peter and John first and tell them what happened.
Some return to the tomb with Peter and John, others continue to tell
others. The two men run and reach the grave first, still
incredulous of what happened, but they do not see angels only the empty tomb and the
cloth with which they covered it. Some women stay a little longer than the men.
two men and Yeshua first appears to Mary Magdalene and
the others who also stayed. They return to tell everyone that this
Once they embraced Yeshua and they don't believe them either. That afternoon Jesus Christ
appears to two men on the way to Emmaus, who only end up
Recognize it when you arrive at your destination. At which point he
disappears in front of them. They rush back to Jerusalem. In the night
they find the apostles and other followers gathered behind closed doors.
They tell them what happened. They are not believing the story. In that
Instantly Yeshua appears to them in their midst. He sees that they are
paralyzed with fear and invites them to touch it and shows them that it has
flesh and bones, which is not a spirit. They go into a state of euphoria and
They just can't believe what is happening. So he eats grilled fish
before them and explains the scriptures to them in the same way that
had done with the two travelers to Emmaus. He explains that he had to
happen. That everything is written. Tomás was not there and he is late. he
They tell but do not believe. He says that until he touches her wounds and
stick your finger in the side you won't believe.

And that's it. That is the testimony of that first day of the week. Jesus Christ
he is alive because he rose on the third day.

From that day until today it has not changed. Always the same.

Of course, this version, which is consistent with the narrations of the
gospels is mine. That is precisely the point. In the case of
original sources, despite being slightly different from each other, are
consistent with each other, otherwise I could not draw my own
version consistently with the Gospels.

The false testimonies change according to the intention of the liar.
Especially if the lie is very difficult to believe and you want it to be
create. The lie is getting bigger, or it is mutating according to the
convenience of the moment.

That does not happen with a truth. He who believed, believed and if not, then he will
lost. Which is precisely what has happened with the resurrection of
Christ. He is alive because he was resurrected.

##### Names.

Listing names of witnesses to the resurrection is an argument against
of the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection of
Jesus Christ.

The new testament gives lists of people who ate, talked and
they touched Jesus Christ after resurrecting. Listing names is
invitation to investigate the facts, to confirm the facts. those names
they are given while people are still alive. in the testimonials
false ones tend to be ambiguous and diffuse in the information so that they do not
be easily verifiable.

##### Women.

The fact that the first witnesses are women is an argument against the
falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection of
Jesus Christ.

For a Jew of the time of Yeshua, the testimony of a woman had no
statutory value. It wasn't relevant.

The fact that the testimonies of the gospels agree that the first
people to see Yeshua resurrected were women is an indication of
truth in testimony. This fact shows that the intention of the
testimonials is not convincing the listener but simply telling the truth.
What actually happened.

Ask a Jewish woman what happened, in times of
Jesus Christ, it was like asking the family dog ​​today.
His testimony was simply irrelevant. If the intention was to convince
the other Jews relying on prejudices of the time made a
lousy job. The alternative is that it just happened.

##### Groups.

The fact that there are appearances to groups is an argument against falsehood
of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

In several passages of the new testament the testimony is that Jesus Christ
He appeared to several people at the same time. They touch it, eat it,
They walk and talk with him. Several people at the same time. They
They remember and he remembers them. He recognizes them and they recognize him. The
recollection of the apparition remains the same and the person is willing to
to remain in his testimony at the cost of great suffering and even
death.

That doesn't happen with hallucinations. I repeat: THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH
HALLUCINATIONS.

##### They suffered.

The fact that most of the first witnesses have lost everything by believing
in Jesus Christ is an argument against the falsity of the testimonies
Biblical accounts of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were members of the Sanhedrin. for being
believers in Yeshua lost everything. They lost his money, his position
and their family rejected them.

Even today for a Jew, believing in Yeshua implies great sacrifices.
It implies losing your previous life. In the vast majority of cases it
he suffers family rejection and the rejection of other Jews.

But the testimony indicates that these people were willing to
stand by his word that Yeshua is alive because he was resurrected at the cost
to be imprisoned, flogged, stoned, boiled in
oil, crucify them or behead them.

That doesn't happen with someone who makes up a lie to keep it
means dying.

##### Body.

The inexistence of testimonies that contradict the disappearance of the
dead body of Jesus Christ is an argument against the falsity of the
biblical testimonies about the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Jesus Christ had anticipated his resurrection, the Jews knew of this and
that is why they requested to place guards at the tomb. Before the testimonies
of a resurrection, the Jewish or Roman authorities the only thing that
they had to do was present the body of the deceased to stop the
alleged lie. It was in the interest of both authorities to stop the
movement. For the Jews for the same reason they killed him, prevent
that they believed in the Son of YHWH. And for the Romans to avoid the
motion disturbances. But the response of the Jews was
persecute those who believed it and the response of the Romans was the
silence.

And the followers were the ones who suffered the most with his alleged lie.
They did not even have to confess where the body was supposedly
they had hidden so that they would not be persecuted, it was simply enough to
not believe what they believed, that Yeshua was the Meshiakh of Israel and that he is
I live because I rise. They didn't.

The movement increased without even an impersonation appearing
of the body.

Furthermore, according to the testimony of the gospels, the religious leaders
implicitly accepted the disappearance of the body when they invented
a story to explain that the disciples had stolen the body.
If the Jews spread that lie early, there is a reason.
to explain why later they did not try an impersonation. Yes
we say that the disciples stole it and destroyed it not
does it make any sense that afterwards we end up finding the
body that others destroyed.

The body of a dead man who was supposedly resurrected does not disappear so
easily especially if his grave is guarded by those who
they killed

##### Embarrassing.

The fact that embarrassing events are recorded for the witness is an argument in
against the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection
of Jesus Christ.

The testimonies of the gospels show some witnesses who
abandoned their leader, who denied knowing him while they were
prosecuting and that even after he was resurrected they refused to believe until
touch his hand and foot wounds and put his hand on the side that
they had been pierced by a Roman spear. They recognize that they
appeared first to women and that they did not believe them when they
They told what happened.

Acknowledging embarrassing issues is a positive criterion for determining the
credibility of a testimony of a judicial or historical process.

#### Planes.

Believing in airplanes today is not funny, but a thousand years ago
years talking about a machine that flies, that has wings like birds, that
It is made of metal, weighing tons, carrying people sitting on it.
its interior, which flies ten times faster than a dove and that some
One day hundreds of thousands of such machines would be built to travel
great distances was quite difficult. Perhaps it would be necessary to see a
aircraft in operation to believe it.

Something like this seems to be what happened to the first believers, they saw
something really extraordinary. Something that only the creator could have
done. They saw a dead man who had come back to life. As I know them
Yeshua had anticipated before he died. As it was written more than
500 years before. They ate with him, touched him, hugged him, talked to him.
him, they walked with him. That's why they believed what they believed and that's why
They changed how they changed.

Me personally, I can't help but believe it anymore. It is already something real. For me
it is already a faith. But the reasons stated here are not the only ones.
So far the reasons have been rational. But the reasons
are becoming experimental and more logical reasons are found and
more physical evidence. The reasons feed off each other. it starts
a new life. It is born again. You begin to live what you believe. Y
it is a battle. Paul calls it the good fight.

Once you begin to believe that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is something
possible, something even feasible, can start a radical change from seeing
life. Because death is no longer the end, life becomes eternal,
because it continues after the resurrection, and priorities change.

I say "can" because it depends on how much the one who is alive, the one who is
in the sky that we see, the one who loves me, the one who looks for me, is
finding.

But the promise is that you will find me, because after the
resurrection of the dead, when we meet again face to face with
the people we have hurt and with whom they have hurt us
damage, it will be impossible to say:

 "Nerd. It is that I do not believe in the resurrection of the dead.

After your resurrection, you will remember this video. You
he will remember me and all the people with whom he interacted
one way or another before his resurrection.

We're going to see each other again.

### The Believer.

When they ask Jesus Christ, according to John 6: What
shall we do so that we may work the works of God? [^59]. Yeshua answers:
This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has
sent [^60]. And a little later in the same conversation
insists: Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever believes in me
has eternal life [^61].

Believe in the one that God has sent. But what is the minimum to be able to
call someone a believer? What is the minimum to believe in which God
has sent? To work the works of God?

Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 that: And if Christ does not
risen, then our preaching is in vain, your preaching is also in vain.
faith [^62].

Which is the climax of Paul's explanation of what
seems to be a kind of chant, recitation, creed, which is already
repeated among believers at the time of writing 1st Corinthians, a
song that says: Christ was killed for our sins according to
the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day,
according to the Scriptures [^63].

The good news, the gospel, Faith in Yeshua, is summed up in that
canticle, in that recitation, in that initial creed quoted in 1st
Corinthians 15.

That is the base, that is the beginning, that is the foundation. that's faith
of the believer in Yeshua, that commonly called Christian. It's what you should
unite all believers regardless of their understanding of the
rest of the writings and the state of their development as new
creature in Christ Jesus.

The believer begins to be a believer when he believes that Jesus Christ, Yeshua,
he is alive because he was resurrected according to the scriptures. I repeat, according to
the Scriptures.

####Tanakh.

The scriptures that Paul speaks of in 1 Corinthians 15, when
proclaims the Christian faith by saying that "Christ was KILLED for our
SINS according to the Scriptures; and that he was BURIED, and that he RISEN
on the third day, according to the SCRIPTURES” [^64], are the scriptures that
he knew as a Pharisee as a Hebrew as a Jew. are the scriptures
Hebrew, the tanakh.

Jesus Christ after resurrected, according to Luke 24, explains the
scriptures, the tanakh, to two disciples on their way to a village
called Emmaus, Luke tells that: "he began to explain to them all the
passages of Scripture that spoke of him, beginning with the books
of Moses and continuing through all the books of the prophets” [^65]. And more
late that night when they were meeting with the apostles
tells them “what has happened to me is what I told you when I was
still with you: that everything that was written about
me in the law of Moses, in the books of the prophets and in the psalms”
[^66]. The word Tanakh is precisely the abbreviation of Torah, Neviim and
Ketuvim, the Hebrew words for the books of Moses, the books of
the prophets and the other writings that include the Psalms.

These explanations that Jesus Christ makes to his disciples and apostles and
all that Paul does to the Jews in different parts of the
Mediterranean are AFTER the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

If a Jew does not believe that Jesus Christ was resurrected, it is impossible for him to
come to understand that the entire Tanakh, absolutely ALL the Tanakh,
points to his Meshiakh, the Meshiakh of Israel: from Adam and Eve, passing
by patriarchs, judges, and kings, to the last of the
prophets. ALL of the Tanakh points to the Meshiakh of Israel. won't be able to do it
because he does not have the Spirit that allows him to believe in his Meshiakh. So
Jesus Christ only explained the Tanakh, and the way in which the Meshiakh of
Israel completes it, explains it, fulfills it, to those who saw it
risen, after seeing him risen.

If you are a Jew and you already believe that Jesus Christ is risen, go and read Isaiah
53, let's see if she doesn't start crying.

#### Caveat.

From this point on, this is a presentation of the best
understanding that Jose Luis Quiroga has of the scriptures, of the
Bible, until today, year 2021, based on more than 20 years of reading the
scriptures, more than 15 years of study of them, and more than 10 years of
study based on the codification of the bible in Hebrew words and
Greeks made by Mr. James Strong to clarify the
inconsistencies generated by interpretations in other languages.
Study that takes into account the different points of view that are
found on the Internet and that makes use of processing techniques
of information that the author has due to his professional technical training.

The author reserves the right to be COMPLETELY wrong as
change position at any time and without the slightest feeling of
guilt or condemnation, if the Spirit that gives him Life shows him that this
wrong.

It is your responsibility, if you are really interested, to study for yourself.
count the scriptures and come to your own conclusions.

This warning is also an invitation for you not only to read, but
may he also seek to understand the original scriptures on his own.
You don't need to speak Hebrew or Greek for that, you just need the Internet. An
portal that I recommend is biblehub.com because it has the entire bible
encoded in Strong codes, so that the bible can be navigated
original in different ways and understand the original scriptures in
Hebrew, the one the original Hebrew authors had in mind when
they wrote their books under the inspiration of the Spirit of the living God.


HOME_SCRIPT
### Mr.

According to the Bible, Yeshua is Lord.

In John 3 John the Baptist says that: “The Father loves the Son
and has put ALL things in his hand” [^67].

In Hebrews 1 its author tells us, speaking of Jesus Christ, that:
"constituted heir of ALL and through whom,
likewise, he made the UNIVERSE” [^68].

And Paul affirms in Ephesians 10 that God's plan is that: "in Christ be
gathered under one head ALL things, both those that are in the
heavens as those that are on earth” [^69].

Paul also explains in Colossians 1 that Jesus Christ: “is
the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of ALL creatures. Because
by him were created ALL things that are in heaven, and that
they are on earth, visible and invisible; be thrones, be dominions,
be they principalities, be they powers; EVERYTHING was created by him and for him. Y
he is before ALL things, and by him ALL things hold together.”
[^70]

So Jesus Christ was the first and through him everything was created,
everything, everything And everything was created for him. And that is why they all subsist
things.

And according to Matthew 11 Yeshua himself tells us that: "ALL things have been
delivered by my Father” [^71].

And in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul explains that God: “has subjected
all things under his feet. But when she says, "All things
are subject to him," clearly he is excepting the one who subjected him
all things”, that is, God Himself [^72].

Like someone who says everything, everything, everything, except the Father himself. That's why in
The entire New Testament calls him "our lord."

#### Heaven of heaven.

And as if to be clear about what is included when he says "all things" in
Deuteronomy 10 can be read that: “The heavens belong to the Lord your God, and
the heavens of heavens: the earth, and all things that are in it”
[^73].

All things are his because he made them, according to Nehemiah 9: "You, O
Jehovah, you are alone; you made the heavens, and the heavens of heavens, and
all his militia, the earth and all that is in it, the seas and all
what is in them; and you give life to all these things, and the armies
of heaven adore you” [^74]. He not only made them but he maintains them
running.

In 1st Kings 8 it tells us that: “Behold, the heavens, the
heavens of heavens, they cannot contain you” [^75]. not even heaven
of heaven can contain the Father. And he repeats it to us in 2nd Chronicles
2 [^76] and in 2nd Chronicles 6 [^77].

And in psalm 68 he also tells us about the heaven of heavens [^78]. And in
Psalm 148 says that: "Praise him, heavens of heavens, and
the waters that are above the heavens” [^79].

In several of them a difference is made between the heavens and the heaven of the
Heavens. And according to Nehemiah, YHWH, the Father, also made them and not only them.
He did but "quickens" them.

#### Angels.

Of course the angels are part of "all things" and since
Yeshua, according to Mark 12, tells us that we will be like the angels in heaven
[^80]. It seems like a good idea to know what the bible says about these characters.

The angels, or messengers of YHWH, according to the Bible, look and act
exactly like men. According to Genesis 18, when Abraham was in front of his
store, suddenly appear, next to him, some men that he
recognizes and calls them YHWH and then the Bible calls them with the word
Hebrew for angels. In this passage of the bible we can see that these
characters talk, eat and walk [^81] and that the bible uses the words
Hebrew of "men", "YHWH" and "angels" to refer to them. In
Genesis 19, just before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, we see that
they can also have sex and in Genesis 32 an angel fights with Jacob [^82].
The angel touches him and Jacob is left lame. In 1 Kings 19 an angel touches
Elijah several times [^83]. And in Zechariah 4 an angel shakes Zechariah
to wake him up [^84]. Angels have a physical body. Such as
Jesus Christ after resurrected. Philippians 3 says that Jesus Christ
"will transform our body of humiliation so that it has
the same form of his body of glory" [^85]. And they can also kill
persons. In 2nd Kings 19 a single angel kills 185 thousand people in one
night [^86].

But remember that it is not the only thing they can do. According to 1 Chronicles
21, can float between heaven and earth [^87]. similar to how the
Yeshua himself rose to heaven, after being resurrected, according to
Acts 1 [^88].

Angels can appear from one moment to another in a place
anyone, like Yeshua himself, according to Luke 24 and John 20, who
appears in the midst of the apostles, being these behind closed doors
[^89]. Something similar to the teleportation shown by the
science fiction movies. Thus, the angels apparently do not
they need to walk to get from one place to another.

They can also become invisible to some eyes and at the same time visible
to other eyes as happened to Balaam and his donkey [^90] in Numbers 22 or
as happened to Elisha and his servant in 2nd Kings 6. When
“Elisha prayed, saying, I beg you, O LORD, to open his
eyes to see” and YHWH opens the eyes of the servant, and he sees that “the
mountain was full of horsemen and chariots of fire, around
Elisha” [^91] .

Furthermore, John says of his vision of Heaven in Revelation 5 that: “I looked, and
I heard the voice of many angels who were around the throne, of the
living beings and the elderly. There were millions and millions of them."
[^92], so there are quite a few angels. In fact, according to Jeremiah 33 neither
they can't even be counted [^93].

In Nehemiah 9 we are told that: “You keep everyone alive; the
armies of heaven worship you” [^94]. And Jesus Christ, according to Matthew 26,
tells Peter that he tries to defend him when they are going to arrest him:
“Do you think that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
would you give me more than twelve legions of angels?” [^95]. armies and legions
from them. They are definitely organized.

In Joshua 5 we are told that: “The Chief of the Army of the YHWH responded to
Joshua: Remove the sandals from your feet, because the place where you are
holy is. And Joshua did so” [^96]. They have a Chief of their army.

And the author of Hebrews explains to us in Hebrews 1 that Yeshua, Jesus Christ,
was made superior to the angels and inherited a name more excellent than the
of them, because God never said of an angel: “You are my son; I. .. you
I have begotten today”, and he never said of an angel “I will be for him, Father; Y
he will be for me, Son” and furthermore God commands: “All the angels adore him
of God” [^97] citing Psalms 2 [^98], 1st Chronicles 17 [^99] and 2nd
Samuel 7 [^100].

Yeshua is Lord of everything, everything, everything, except the Father who was the one
He gave her everything, everything, everything.

What angels do NOT have are wings. nowhere in the bible
we are told that angels have wings. angels are in
indistinguishable appearance of a descendant of Adam and Eve, of a
person born on this planet. According to Hebrews 13: “Some, without knowing it,
entertained angels” [^101]. They are indistinguishable.

#### At.

Those who do have wings are the Serafim of Isaiah 6, the Cherubim of
Ezekiel and the living creatures or animals of Revelation 4. 3 names
different for the same creatures that surround the throne of God [^102].
But another meaning of the Hebrew word is “extremity” [^103], so
they can easily be something other than wings as we see in birds.

In these 4 creatures it seems that the 6 extremities [^104] that it says
John correspond with those of Isaiah [^105] and with those of Ezekiel
[^106] if 2 are calf feet with some wing structure, 2 are
arms with some wing structure and 2 are wings as we see in the
Eagles.

These creatures seem to be simple animals more than any other
stuff. These creatures do not appear to be very intelligent or have
awareness. The most they do is repeat a phrase like parrots [^107],
or pass an object [^108]. Also when they do this, it only happens in one
vision and not in a narrative that describes physical events. in these
tasks, as intelligent as a dog or a parrot. in fact some
they function as watchdogs according to Genesis 3 [^109]. or protectors,
according to Ezekiel 28 [^110], which directly compares the king of Tyre, and the
Satan indirectly, with one of these animals, perhaps because of what the
Satan was from the heavenly council, that is, very close to YHWH.

The translation of Seraf, the singular of Serafim, is serpent. An animal.
And 3 of the total of 4 faces that the Cherubim have are of an animal: one is
one is an eagle, one is a calf and one is a lion. And his legs are from
calf, although they also appear to have some wing structure.
Also, according to Psalm 18, YHWH likes to ride them [^111].

Powerful animals, very intelligent, for animals, and very beautiful,
but animals after all. Some kind of heavenly pets.
Creatures that only the creator could have designed because according to Ezekiel
they seem to have the body of a man [^112] and have capacities
extraordinary ones like changing his face to any of 4 possible [^113].
A kind of biological transformer. They emit light that comes from their
interior that appears to be like burning coal flames [^114]. One of
they even take with their hand of said fire inside them and give it to
a man dressed in linen [^115]. And, according to Ezekiel 1, they run like the
lightning [^116].

Powerful animals but animals after all.

#### Creation.

The Bible describes creation, or what the author of Hebrews 9 calls
“THIS creation” [^117], in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2.

Many people try to reconcile what the text of Genesis says
with the ideas of a religion that passes itself off as science. or with ideas
preconceived of what the text narrates.

But there is really no need if we read the text as it is.

And if we do not deny what is logically obvious: That there HAS to be a
creator.

And let's remember that it HAS to exist because

If we are going to call the human being intelligent, designer and creative, for
all planes, shoes, cell phones, cars, all over the
technology, which has built,

We have to

To admit, by logical necessity, that the complexity of the machinery
that we observe in plants and animals requires a technology of
someone much more intelligent, designer and creative than being
human. A creator.

It is simple observation and logic.

That's why we remember that in this video we seek to understand the events
extraordinary narrated in the bible in the light of current technology and
than we can logically project into the future. and not in the light
of the technology we believe the biblical authors had. is it
logical. It is a better approximation to the technological creativity of the
Creator. The evidence shows us that it is much more advanced.

Doing this and studying a bit of the original Hebrew, the description of
Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 can be understood consistently with
futuristic projections of the current technology of man.

The first verse delimits us that it is going to speak of two parts: the
shamayim, translated as the heavens, and the earth. "In it
beginning God created the heavens and the earth” [^118].

Here it is important to clarify that the Hebrew word to create also accepts
the idea of ​​building, organizing, shaping, assembling.

In the next verse we see that there were things pre-existing to that
that he is going to create, organize or assemble: “And the earth was
formless and empty, and darkness was over the face of the deep, and
the Spirit of God moved over the face of the waters” [^119]. there was already
a “disorderly land”, an “abyss” and some “waters”. and everything was
dark and messy. It is not difficult to imagine a planet full of water
but empty and dark from the lack of a transparent atmosphere.

The multiple interdependence of plants, animals and
environment. The functioning of the biological machinery depends
mutually, in multiple ways, from other biological machineries, for
That's called ecosystems. But there is also a dependency on the
means, medium. The biological machinery of this planet can only function at
certain temperatures, certain atmospheric pressures, some only in
presence of oxygen, of air, because they need to breathe, many
they need to consume water to continue functioning. whole system
biology of the planet depends on characteristics that only this
planet.

Thus, it is not difficult to imagine that everything had to be put in
operation in a period of time that would allow the global system
start without crashing. A span of time like that described in Genesis 1
and 2: 6 spins of the planet on its axis. 6 days. Spot.

##### Day 1.

The third verse of the Bible tells us what Elohim did on the first day:
“And God said: Let there be light: and there was light” [^120]. Yes
we follow the established context, it is the moment in which the creator gives
order to use its highly advanced technology to generate an atmosphere that
allow the passage of light and you can begin to differentiate the day from the
evening. The process starts and it takes no more than one rotation of this
planet on its axis before it is possible to distinguish the two
states: one light and one dark.

##### Day 2.

The sixth verse sums up the second day for us: “And he said
God: Let there be expansion in the midst of the waters, and separate the waters from the
waters” [^121]. Following the given context, it is the moment in which the
order to create, according to a pre-established design, a separation of waters,
one body of water is directly on the planet and the other body of
water is in an outermost orbit above that expansion. To the
space between the two masses of water, to that expansion, he calls "shamaim"
which translates "heavens".

##### Day 3.

On the third day Elohim separates the dry from the lower body of water, the
that was under the heavens. If the text is reconciled with the
physical evidence that we see even today, even after the times
of Noah, the process generates a shell of granite around the planet
which has an interconnected subterranean ocean below and with large
shallow lakes to said shell. Upon said shell of granite,
the creator appears, or using film-type terminology:
tele-generated by globalized parallel atomic copy, all vegetation,
all the plants, already mature, with which he had thought to start the
reproductive process of the plant kingdom.

##### Day 4.

The fourth day modifies the atmosphere enough so that it can be
observe the sun during the day and the moon and stars at night. It is
observe that objects external to the atmosphere already existed
physically. The plasma candle we call the sun and the object
quasi-spherical that reflects the light coming from the sun and that we call
moon, they already existed physically. What he believes at this moment, what he
shapes, organizes, arranges, are the lights, or stars in some
translations. He creates them through the physical transformations in
temperature, distance, rotation, and so on, which are necessary for
keep the biological machinery on the planet running.

##### Day 5.

On the fifth day Elohim gives the order to create all the aquatic animals
adults and adult birds with which it decided, during the design stage,
start the reproductive process of these animals. And he did it so
similar to how he created all the vegetation on the planet, by tele-copying
globalized parallel atomic, to use terminology of type
film. In other words, a three-dimensional and parallel atomic copy-paste.

##### Day 6.

On the sixth day he made the rest of the adult animals, the terrestrial ones, and on the
first man. In a similar way to how I create plants, animals
aquatic and birds, similarly as a human being of this
time creates a document on your computer. He tells him "mijito create
document". In this case everything was done through another son, the
master copy: the son of God, the Lord of Lords, the King of Kings, The
Only Begotten Son of God, The First and the Last, The Meshiakh of Israel:
Yeshua HaMashiakh, Our Savior Jesus Christ. that could have done it
early in the morning in a nanosecond. He left homework to the creation of him,
Adam, to give names to domestic animals and ONLY domestic animals.
Both those of the air and those of the field, but only the domestic ones,
logical. The Hebrew word H929 [^122] indicates this. And then over there
the evening, when Adam had already done his homework, Elohim puts him to sleep and
Create your partner.

##### Easy.

If we really accept the logical. What:

If we are going to call the human being intelligent, designer and creative, for
all planes, shoes, cell phones, cars, all over the
technology, which has built,

We have to

To admit, by logical necessity, that the complexity of the machinery
that we observe in plants and animals requires a technology of
someone much more intelligent, designer and creative than being
human. A creator.

If we really accept that there HAS, by logical necessity, to be a
creator with a technology that we can barely imagine.

And if we read Genesis 1 and 2 as they are written, and not as we were taught
read them, or how we want to read them so that they fit our ideas
preconceived, it is not so difficult to believe them.

Today, with today's technology, imagining that of the creator, it is not
Hard to believe the first two chapters of Genesis.

The Bible is a practical book. It tells us about what we can see, about what
that we can touch, of what is within our reach, of what we can
check. Not from alpha-centaur and from galaxies to billions of years
light.

#### The above.

But according to the same scriptures, according to the bible, there are things that
They were before the creation described in Genesis 1 and 2.

##### God.

The very word Elohim, who is the Creator, according to Genesis 1 and 2, already
He existed since he is the creator. Thus, Elohim is not part of what
created in Genesis 1 and 2. It was already, it already existed. It's obvious but you have to
mention it because there are people who like to deny the obvious.

##### Yeshua.

Yeshua, our Lord Jesus Christ, even if not everyone is aware that it is
their lord, or do not want to recognize him as such, is neither part of
THIS creation nor of anything created. According to John 1, “In the beginning
was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. She
It was in the beginning with God. All things were made through
her, and without her nothing was made that was made. In her
was life, and life was the light of men” and then tells us
that: “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us,
and we contemplate his glory, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father full
grace and truth." And he ends up identifying the Word with
Jesus Christ saying "grace and truth have
come through Jesus Christ.” All things were made by
through Yeshua and without Him nothing was made that was made.
Yeshua is prior to all creation including THIS creation.

##### The Sons of Elohim.

The "beni-haelohim", the sons of Elohim [^123], the union of the
words H1121 and H430 of the Strong code are not part of ESTA either
creation. Nowhere in Genesis 1 and 2 does this expression appear. The
Satan is part of this group and so are the angels. the book of job
it indicates so. The Bible refers to men as the sons of
Adam, not like the sons of Elohim. Thus, the sons of Elohim do not
part of THIS creation.

##### The Angels.

Nowhere in the creation account in Genesis 1 and 2 does the
Hebrew word H4397 [^124], the word “malakh” in the singular, or
“malakhim” in the plural, used in the Bible for “angel” or “messenger”.
In addition, in Psalm 8, the word Elohim is also used, that which is
the Creator, to refer to the angels as a whole [^125]. The
angels are not part of THIS creation.

##### The Satan and company.

The "bení-haelohim" who are not any little angel, all those children of
Elohim who opposed YHWH, Jehovah, Elohim, when he created the being
human, they are not part of THIS creation either. Among them is Satan,
the ancient serpent, the devil, the first liar and the first
murderer, all titles of the person who is only named in the bible by
these titles. The same one that initiates the little problem of disobedience to
cheat on eve Satan and company are not part of THIS creation
because they are a subset of the beni-haelohim who are not part of
of THIS creation.

##### The Winged Ones.

The Serafim of Isaiah 6, the Cherubim of Ezekiel and the creatures
living beings or animals of Revelation 4, those of which we have already spoken,
they were created. These mighty animals that are ridden by YHWH and
that have 6 extremities and 4 possible faces, these species of
biological transformers that are celestial pets, were already created
when Elohim created this heaven and this earth.

##### The stars.

Neither do the stars. The only occurrence of the word used in the bible
for “star”, the word H3556 [^126], is under the verb GOVERN,
NOT under the verb CREATE. This is an example of how even
translators are carried away by preconceived ideas. The lesser star, or
be it the light of the moon, governs the night and the "kakobim", that is, the
stars. The stars are also not part of what was created in Genesis 1 and
2. This is perfectly consistent with the fact that the "heavens" of the
Genesis also have a heaven, which was also created by YHWH alone
than BEFORE THIS creation.

##### A part of the armies of Heaven.

The armies of heaven include the sons of Elohim, Satan and
company, the angels, the stars and all the animals that fly
in the sky. And since only the last ones are part of THIS creation, good
part of the armies of heaven are NOT part of THIS creation. In
Genesis 1 were completed YES, when the animals that
fly in the sky, but before THIS creation there was already a good part
of the armies of heaven. The Hebrew word for “armies”, the
word H6635 [^127], the word “tsaba” only appears ONE time in Genesis
1, and appears AFTER the creation of man, and in the context of
FINISH the “armies” of what is on earth and in the heavens that
they have just been created. A good part of the armies of the heavens already
existed BEFORE THIS creation.

##### Heaven of Heavens.

The expression heaven of heaven is rarely used in the Bible. is the
union of the word H8064 in the singular with the same in the plural [^128].
Shami-hashamayim and on various occasions it is used in contrast to the
plural only referring to the shamayim created in Genesis 1, as used
for example in Deuteronomy 10 [^129]. First in the plural and then the
combination separated by a vev, the Hebrew letter used to separate
phrases. The shamaim is part of THIS creation, the one narrated in Genesis 1
and 2. The sky of the heavens no. That already was, already existed. In it
were the sons of Elohim, Satan and company, the angels and the
stars. Well, the Satan and company were not yet the Satan and
company, it was still a few more angels, they had not objected. But the
idea is clear.

#### Consistency.

What was created in Genesis 1 and 2 is what we see on this planet: plants,
animals, people, the earth and the skies, those that if we look to
above we can see that they have clouds and that in Noah's time they had waters
above. The bible is practical, it does not tell us about other planets or things
to which man has no access. The theme of Genesis 1 and 2 is
limited to THIS creation.

Of course this is only ONE way to coherently understand the
bible with what the technical creativity of man that we use in the day
today allows us to project logically. Because if we compare it with the
technical creativity necessary for all the biological machinery that
we observe in everyday life: plants, animals and people, it is
rationally undeniable that there HAS to be a much larger Creator
intelligent and creative than the human being. That Elohim of Genesis 1. This
is just what seems to be the most literal of all ways of
understand a text that has to be designed for all ages and
all the times.

Technical creativity is the best criterion to distinguish a religion
of a science. Yes, Christianity is a Faith. He has never denied it. Yes,
claims to be the only true faith because it comes from the only God
real. But it is much more logical and coherent, with that creativity
technique that we observe, that the rest of the religions, including some
pretending to be science.

According to the bible, Yeshua is Lord of Lords over EVERYTHING, everything, everything
including everything prior to THIS creation, because these things ALSO
they were created by Yeshua and were given to him by his Father.

This way of understanding the Bible does not contradict anything that is
written on it and seems to be the most literal of all.


HOME_SCRIPT
### Savior.

According to the bible, in Luke 2, it is said of Yeshua that: "you
Today, in the city of David, a Savior has been born, who is CHRIST the
Lord” [^130], and in John 4 some Samaritans say of Jesus Christ that:
“We ourselves have heard, and we know that truly this is the
Savior of the world, the Christ” [^131].

Thus, according to the Bible, Jesus Christ is Savior.

But savior from what? What save us?

There are only two ways to see existence:

1. Physical death is the end. Spot. It's all over and it's for
    forever. Physical death is eternal. Or exclusively
2. Physical death is NOT the end. Jesus Christ was physically resurrected,
    is alive, and physical life is eternal because we are going to see each other again
    after the PHYSICAL resurrection of the PHYSICAL dead. and that
    physical resurrection is to never die again physically because
    You cannot die physically, that is what Jesus Christ affirms.

Thus, Jesus Christ saves us from death.

To make the concept clear from the biblical point of view, let us see that
the bible tells us.

#### Lifetime.

In various parts of the gospels our Lord Jesus Christ, Yeshua,
refers to life

In John 14 he says: "I am the way, the truth and the life" [^132].

In John 11 he states: “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me
even if he dies, he will live” [^133].

In John 8: “I am the light of the world. He who follows me will never walk in
darkness but will have the light of life” [^134].

In John 6: “I am the bread of life” [^135].

In John 17: “And this is eternal life: that they know you
you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.”
[^136].

In short, Life, according to the Bible in the voice of Jesus Christ, is Himself,
Jesus Christ, Yeshua. And as 1st John 2 says:

"But if anyone says, 'I know him,' and does not obey his commandments, he is
a liar and there is no truth in him. Instead, if one obeys his
word, in him the love of God is truly perfected, and of
that way we know that we are united to him. The one who says that he is attached to
God, you must live as Jesus Christ lived." [^137] As if to say: loving.

This physical life that Jesus speaks of is eternal, it does not end with death
physical because it continues after the resurrection of the dead. Only
is interrupted.

Paul explains in Philippians 3 that Jesus Christ
"will transform our body of humiliation so that
have the same shape as his body of glory" [^138]. The one who ate
roasted fish according to Luke 24, which can be touched, and which went up to heaven and
they saw him until a cloud covered him according to Acts 1.

If you believe this, you are really alive. It begins to live according to
what is believed. That physical life continues and that the manner of
to stay alive is to follow Yeshua, YHWH, through his Spirit that
lives in us, his Ruakh Hakodesh. To live as Yeshua lives. loving.
Following the Law, the Precepts, the Commandments. loving them to be able
follow them. Doing what is good according to YHWH, not according to my heart.

YHWH himself explains through his prophet Ezekiel that:

"If the wicked turn away from all the sins he has committed, and fulfill
all my laws and does what is right and just, he shall surely live and not
will die I will not remember all the bad things he did, and he will live
for doing what is right. I do not want the wicked to die, but
Change your behavior and live. I, the Lord, affirm it.

But if the righteous man fails to act righteously, and does all that is evil and
detestable thing that the wicked does, do you think that he will continue
living? I will not remember all the good things I have done:
he will die because of his infidelity and his sins” [^139].

He who does good lives and he who does evil dies. follow Christ,
to live as Yeshua lives, is to do what is good, is to be alive. Yeshua is the
Lifetime. His Spirit gives us Life.

But it is impossible to live as Yeshua lives if I believe that he is dead, that
resurrected That death is the end.

If we believe that physical death is the end, we are still dead
spiritually, because according to the bible we are born to this physical life
spiritually dead. We are born without a relationship with the Father. Relationship
that only faith in Jesus Christ can begin.

If we believe that physical death is not the end, the death has already begun.
transformation of the mind, we are already born again to a spiritual life and
all things are made new.

Only the resurrection of Yeshua allows us to see the existence in the
second form because it is the only example of which there is authentic
evidence. The problem is that no one, absolutely no one, can
for someone to believe the latter, only the Father can do that. U.S
explains Jesus Christ himself in John 6: "No one can come to me, except
Father who sent me no” [^140] “drags him first” [^141].

Some may only begin to believe in the resurrection of the dead
until after they are resurrected. But it's always better to be alive than
dead.

#### Death.

Death is the absence of life, the non-existence of life. If it is defined
in this way death, we can say that just as we have life
physical, emotional, mental and, for those born in Christ, a life
spiritual, an eternal life, likewise we have a respective death
for each absence of each of these lives. A physical death
emotional death, a mental death and a spiritual death.

According to the Bible, all descendants of Adam are born dead.
spiritually. We are born without the spirit of Yeshua, who is The Life
same. Who gives us that spiritual life. Who gives us a relationship with
the father.

According to the bible, when Jehovah created man he created him with this relationship,
alive not only physically but also spiritually, but warned him
“Saying: Of every tree of the garden you shall eat; More from the tree of science
of good and evil you shall not eat of it; because the day you eat of it,
you will die.” [^142].

According to John 8, Jesus Christ identifies his opponent, Satan, if
we translate into Hebrew, with the father of lies, with the murderer from
the beginning, with the devil. According to Matthew 23, with the serpent and the
viper [^143]. And according to Revelation 20, with the dragon, the devil and the
ancient serpent [^144].

The first serpent mentioned in the Bible, that is, the father of the
lie and murderer from that beginning, that father of the Pharisees and
scribes who opposed Jesus Christ deceives Eve. She tells him: "Of
Have you really told them: Do not eat from any tree in the garden?” [^145].
He exaggerates what YHWH has said and then lies: “Surely they will not die. It is
that God knows that in the day they eat of it, their eyes will be opened, and
they will be like God, knowing good and evil” [^146].

Eve eats the fruit, Adam eats the fruit and YHWH expels them from Eden.
They lose access to the Tree of Life, and what happens? They die. no longer have
relationship with the Father, they can no longer eat from the Tree of Life and die.
They die spiritually and the consequence of spiritual death is death.
physical death. Maybe not immediately but it is the end result.
Adam ends up living 930 years and dies. He eventually dies too
physically. Spiritual death results in death
physical.

The text of Genesis from the second chapter, fourth verse,
change. Stop using the word Elohim and start using the word YHWH.
The narrative ceases to be strictly sequential, day by day, and becomes
be more generic and less chronological. More allegorical and less literal.

But it can be read literally.

It is not difficult for a 21st century person to imagine that a snake
speak if you have the technology to make it speak. Moses, according to
Jesus Christ, in John 5, was the one who wrote the text. And when
Moses wrote this, he had already seen bushes speak, and walking sticks
become serpents, and seas split in two, and bread falls from the sky
for months. So writing about a snake talking to a
woman, it was not a fairy tale for Moses. If he really
He lived what he says he lived. And, if Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected,
the text was written by Moses, it is true, and Moses lived what he said
that lived.

And, when YHWH speaks to the serpent, he is speaking to the one who manipulated
the snake. Similar to when Jesus speaks to the legion of
unclean spirits that manipulated the man of the province of the
Gadarenes, according to Mark 5 [^147]. To man as such alone
he speaks to him AFTER having expelled the unclean spirits.

In Genesis 3, YHWH says to the serpent: "Because
you have done this, you will be cursed above all beasts and above all
farm animals; on your chest you will walk, and dust you will eat all the
days of your life." [^148]. As who says, since you think you are very
snake, you're going to be one more. He tells Satan, the father of the
lie. And from then on she kept the title. title that
Jesus Christ uses with the Pharisees who opposed him: serpents,
vipers

The text can be read literally if we can believe the context, if
we can believe that Moses lived what he said he lived. If we can
imagine the necessary technology. And if we do NOT think we are smarter or
evolved than whoever wrote it.

And according to Paul, everything is going according to plan. In 1 Corinthians 15 he tells us:
“Since death entered through a man,
Also through a man has come the resurrection of the dead.”
[^149].

Yeshua brings us the resurrection. Yeshua is the Life. Yeshua saved us from
death.

It is NOT avoiding death that saves us, because we are born dead
spiritually and physically we are going to die anyway. It is
REMOVING US from the death that saves us.

He first saves us from spiritual death by giving us Life through
his Holy Spirit. And then he will save us from physical death, when we
resurrect everyone on the last day.

#### Liberator.

According to John 8, Jesus Christ affirms that: “Truly, truly, I say to you that
everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin.” [^150] and that:
“If the Son makes you free, you will be truly free”
[^151].

Paul also explains it in Romans 6: “You know
very well that if they give themselves as slaves to a master to obey him,
then they are slaves of that master whom they obey. And this is so, so
if they obey sin, which leads to death, as if they obey
God to live in justice.” [^152]. And he goes on to say, "But
now, freed from sin and made servants of God, they have as their
it rewards sanctification and, ultimately, eternal life. because he pays her
of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ
Jesus” [^153]. And he adds in Romans 8 that “the law of the
Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and from
death” [^154].

Thus, Yeshua frees us from the power that sin has in us. He is a
power from which we cannot escape ourselves. Anyone can
Realize that we are all sinners. We call it “the condition
human”, in quotes. We say: “everyone makes mistakes”.

Paul also explains in Romans 7 that: "I know that in me
—namely, in my flesh— good does not dwell. Because wanting the good is in
me, but not doing it. Because I do not do the good that I want but, at
On the contrary, the evil that I do not want, that I practice. And if I do what I don't
I want, I no longer carry it out, but the sin that dwells in me.” [^155].
And he adds: “Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from
this body of death? I thank God through Jesus Christ
our Lord!" [^156].

Thus, we pass from a slavery to sin, from which we cannot get out
alone, and is therefore forced, into voluntary slavery to
Jesus Christ. If we willingly choose Jesus Christ as our Master,
our Master, our King, our Lord, is because we obey what
he commands us: to love God above all things, to love our neighbor as
we love ourselves, and love each other as
Jesus Christ loves us.

The slavery allowed in the bible is not what we know as
slavery today. In Leviticus 19, YHWH commands the people of Israel:
“You shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD” [^157].
And Jesus Christ explains that the neighbor, in that law that orders to love the
neighbor, is anyone, even slaves. Those of which, in
Galatians 4, Paul says that: "as long as the heir is a child in nothing
differs from the slave” [^158]. Those who in NOTHING differ from the
heir as a child. Those of whom, according to Deuteronomy 23, YHWH
commands that: "You shall not hand over to his master the slave who comes to you
escaping from his master” [^159]. Those who actually belong to YHWH
just as all of Israel and every creature on this planet belongs to him.
Those who, according to Exodus 21, should be set free if the master's fault
lost an eye [^160], and also, according to Leviticus 24, it would be done to the
master as he did to the slave: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, life
for life [^161].

In Jesus Christ ALL believers are made free from sin, not just believers.
slaves, to freely become slaves of Jesus Christ. Paul explains
in Galatians 3: "There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is no slave
nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ
Jesus” [^162]. And in 1st Corinthians 7 Paul explains that: he “who in the
Lord is called being a SLAVE, he is a FREE man of the Lord. same
Likewise, also he who is called being FREE, is a SLAVE of the Lord.
[^163].

We are all equal in Christ Jesus: willing slaves of Jesus Christ
to be TRULY FREE.

It is God who, through Yeshua, frees us from slavery to
sin by changing our hearts so that we freely become slaves
of Jesus Christ and obey his commandments to love him above all
things for our own good.

#### Principalities and powers.

But let's remember that it all started when the serpent tricked Eve. That
serpent that the bible also calls the Satan, or Satan. word that
it is just a transliteration of the Hebrew word that translates “opposer”.

According to Job 1, the Satan was, at least in Job's day, a
“beni-haelohim”, a son of God [^164]. Satan was a son of Elohim,
the one who created the heavens and the earth. Satan was a son of the creator.
The Hebrew words H1121 and H430 of the Strong's code, the words for
“ben”, “son” and “elohim”, “God”, thus indicate it [^165].

Job 1 says that “one day the sons of God came to present themselves before
of Jehovah, among whom also Satan came” [^166]. Satan was
like the rest of the children of Elohim, like the angels. those who have
body and spirit and relationship with Jehovah. Those who can speak
eat, have sex and are indistinguishable in appearance from a man,
of a son of Adam. Even Satan has a conversation with Jehovah.

Job 1 narrates that:

“And the Lord said to Satan: Where do you come from? And Satan answering the Lord,
He said: To go around the earth, and to walk on it.

And the LORD said to Satan, Have you not considered my servant Job, that there is no
another like him on earth, a perfect and upright man, one who feared God, and
away from evil?

And Satan answering the Lord said, Does Job fear God for nothing?

Have you not surrounded him, and his house, and all that he has in
around? To the work of his hands you have given a blessing; therefore his
farm has grown on the land.

But stretch out your hand now, and touch everything it has, and you will see if it does not
blaspheme on your face.

And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in
your hand: just don't lay your hand on him. And Satan came out of
before Jehovah.” [^167].

That is, a dialogue similar to the one that Abraham has with YHWH, that is, Jehovah, or
be God according to Genesis 18 [^168]. And that Satan and company already
They had done their thing several times.

According to Genesis 6, apparently long before Job, some of these
children did not behave very well that we say because: "It happened that when
men began to multiply on the face of the earth,
daughters were born. And seeing the sons of God that the daughters of men
they were beautiful, they took wives for themselves, choosing among all” [^169]. Y
that "the sons of God were united with the daughters of
men and children were born to them” [^170].

Like who says that Satan and other sons of God began to have
sons with the daughters of men.

There would be no need to differentiate between "sons of God" and "sons of the
men” if it were a cross between sons and daughters of men. Sons
of men with daughters of men was just what God wanted from
a beginning, that's why he said to Adam and Eve: "Be
fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth” [^171].

No. Satan not only deceived Eve, but there were also other little children
of Elohim who were carried away by lust, one of the themes
Satan's favorites, and things got complicated. These little children of Elohim
they end up crossing with the daughters of men.

Little children who obviously cannot be called angels because they never
they were not really messengers of God but opponents of God. That's why the
the bible does not refer to them as malakh, the hebrew word for angels
or messengers of YHWH, but as sons of Elohim. rebellious sons who
from the beginning they became opposed to the creation of Elohim.

The result of all this disobedience both in the
earth as it is in heaven was that, according to Genesis 6: “The LORD saw that the
wickedness of man was great on earth, and that every tendency of the
thoughts of his heart was continually only to evil” [^172]. Their
creation spoiled.

And since he already knew about the theme since before creating man, he continued with
the plan as it was before creation. And he gave a hint.
He did with Noah something similar to what he intended to do definitively
with Yeshua: a clean slate. And he sent the famous global deluge.

The theme obviously continued, because the final solution was Yeshua.

A little while after Noah, apparently also many years before
Job, the influence and dominance of Satan and company continued. Of course without
offspring on earth, but they kept messing with the sons of
Adam. The result was what the Bible describes as the Tower of Babel.
But now it is easier to locate as tower of Éridu. because it remains
in what is now known as Éridu. Even using the famous search engine
and its mapping mechanism can locate the site where you started
build the turret.

From that dominion and influence of Satan and company, from slavery to
sin, of the current world system, ONLY the Spirit of
Yeshua. The one that Yeshua left us after his resurrection. we start
to release when we are born again. When we start to believe that
He is really alive because he was resurrected. He gives us the power to fight
these principalities and powers that want to see us eternally dead.
It is a battle that rages in the heart and mind of every believer.

Paul explains in Ephesians that: “our fight is not against
flesh and blood, but against principalities, against authorities, against
rulers of this darkness, against evil spirits in the
heavenly places” [^173].

And 1 John 5 explains that: “the whole world is under the
evil” [^174].

And Yeshua explains in John 17 about his followers that: “I have given them your
word, and the world hated them because they are not of the world, any more than
I am of the world. I do not ask that you remove them from the world but that you keep them
of the evil one They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world” [^175].
Once someone begins to follow Yeshua, he ceases to be of the world,
cease to be under the bondage of sin. He is released by our
liberator and begins to have the power to combat principalities and
heavenly powers.

And Paul in Romans 8 tells us that “neither death nor
life nor angels nor principalities nor the present nor the future nor powers
neither height nor depth nor any other created thing will be able to separate us
of the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord” [^176]. What
who says nothing nothing nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. It
which reminds me of Psalm 136. Go look it up.

Ephesians 1 speaks of the power of God and "the immeasurable
greatness of his power towards us who believe. And he adds that:
"God exercised it in Christ when he raised him from the dead and
seated at his right hand in heavenly places, above all
principality, authority, power, lordship, and every name that is named, not
only in this age but also in the age to come. Even all things
God subdued under his feet” [^177]. That is to say, Satan and company
are under the feet of the Holy Spirit who lives in all true
believer.

Colossians 2 explains that Yeshua, Jesus Christ, “spoiled the principalities
and the authorities, and exhibited them as a public spectacle having
triumphed over them on the cross” [^178].

It is to be expected that no one is happy that they put their paw on them,
and Satan and company, those that the bible calls principalities and powers
Celestials were no exception. They thought that Adam's idea was a bad idea and
offspring and opposed YHWH's plan from the beginning. Y
They sought to damage it and throw it away as it were.

But YHWH, who knows them all, counted on that from the beginning and
I save it. Paul explains in Romans 16 that: “the
revelation of the mystery that has been kept hidden since time
eternal”, that mystery “has now been made manifest” with Jesus Christ and his
Resurrection. All according to “the prophetic Scriptures and according to the
commandment of the eternal God. And that now “it has been made known to all
the nations". And he ends by saying that all glory be "to the only wise
God” “through Jesus Christ forever. Amen” [^179].

There are two kingdoms:

1. In the hearts and minds of believers in Yeshua, the spirit reigns.
    Holy of Yeshua.
2. And in the hearts and minds of those who have not been born again
    the spirits of the principalities and powers that are in
    rebellion against the Creator, spirits that the Bible calls evil and
    impure, or demons.

Yeshua HaMashiakh gives us his spirit to be able to fight principalities and
heavenly powers.

#### One of two.

According to the bible, the person who does not believe in Yeshua is dead
spiritually. All those who do not follow him, who do not live as he
taught, they are actually dead.

Jesus explains in John 5 that: "I tell you the truth, whoever pays attention to what
whoever I say and believes in the one who sent me, has eternal life; and it won't be
damned, for he has already passed from death to life" [^180].

And in Matthew 8 someone says to him, "Lord, let me first go and
bury my father" and Jesus replies: "Follow me and let the
dead bury your dead" [^181].

He who does not know Jesus is dead. Dead to true life. To
eternal life.

Of course you have a physical life, an emotional life, an intellectual life.
or mental, but you don't have a spiritual life, a transcendental life,
an eternal life. It ends with death. That is what is believed and lived
according to that. He is dead. There is no relationship with the creator.

Paul explains in Ephesians 2 that: "Before you were dead because of
of the evils and sins in which they lived, since they followed the criteria of
this world and did the will of that spirit that dominates in the air
and who encourages those who disobey God" [^182].

In other words, we were spiritually dead for being children of Satan,
like some Pharisees of the time of Jesus.

But, what are those criteria of this world that those who follow
disobey God?

In 1 John 2 it says:

"Do not love the world, nor what is in the world. If anyone loves the world, he does not
love the Father; because nothing that the world offers comes from the Father,
but of the world itself. And this is what the world offers: ill wishes
of human nature, the desire to possess what pleases the eyes and
the pride of riches. But the world is ending, with all its
ill wishes; Instead, he who does the will of God lives to
always" [^183].

Like who says or the world or YHWH, there are no means.

According to John 10 Yeshua affirms that to his sheep, to those who believe in Him:

"I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one
he will snatch them out of my hand" [^184].

And according to John 6 Jesus states:

"All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever gives me
comes I will never cast him out" [^185].

And in John 6 he also states: "And this is the will of him who sent me, that
I do not lose anything of all that he has given me, but raise it up in the
FINAL day". And he reaffirms: "This is the will of my Father: that everyone who
who looks to the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and that I raise him up in
the FINAL day" [^186].

In other words, first the Father gives them to them and then they neither take them away nor throw them out.
outside and the thing continues is at the end, on the last day. Not before.

#### Sleepy.

And meanwhile?

Well, according to John 11, Jesus Christ affirms that: "Our friend Lazarus
sleeps but I go to wake him up" [^187] and then explains "Lázaro has
dead" [^188].

And according to Mark 5 and Luke 8 Yeshua affirms: "The girl is not dead, but
asleep" [^189].

In other words, in the meantime, the body throws dust into the grave and the spirit
asleep with the one who never sleeps, YHWH, watches over him.

According to Ecclesiastes 9 in that dream, "where you are going, there are no works, no
account, or KNOWLEDGE, or wisdom" [^190]. And Ecclesiastes 12,
refers to death, as the moment when “the dust
RETURNS to earth, as it WAS, and the spirit RETURNS to God who
GAVE” [^191]. Things go back to the way they were BEFORE they were alive: the
dust turned to dust and the spirit with God. That's why there are no works, I don't know
can do nothing, no accounts, there is nothing to tell, no knowledge,
nothing can be known, not even God.

The comparison of Jesus Christ has two parts. One refers to the
asleep they have no conscience, they cannot do anything. The other refers
What can they wake up to? It is not an irreversible situation. and god it
can wake people up temporarily to go back to sleep more
late or you can do it permanently so as not to go back to sleep as
He promises to do it on the last day.

In the bible we have several examples of people who have to be
been temporarily awakened, even for times longer than
Adam lived. According to John 21 when he says to Peter: “If I want him to
stay until I come, what to you? Follow me." [^192]. situation that
it is real when Peter, according to Luke 9, tells Jesus Christ:
"Teacher, it is well that we remain here: and let us make three
pavilions, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah” [^193].
Peter offers to build 3 tabernacles, or tents, because they were in the
Jewish festival of Sukot, 2 of them for Moses and Elijah, at the time
commonly known as the transfiguration of Jesus Christ. Both are
physically present and so Peter offers to build two stores and
use them to celebrate Sukkot.

But the first to obtain a definitive physical resurrection, one that
it is to not die, because you can no longer die, it is Jesus Christ. Pablo
explains in Colossians 1 that Jesus Christ “is the beginning, the firstborn
of the dead, so that he may have primacy in everything” [^194].

Jesus Christ sleeps for 3 days and three nights to fulfill the scriptures,
before waking up, before resuscitating. That's why the promise to you
Jesus Christ does to the thief who was crucified with him when he tells him that:
Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in the
paradise” [^195] refers to a future moment but not an immediate one, because
the next three days and three nights Jesus Christ was going to be asleep
in Sheol, which is no paradise.

It is possible that said thief is one of those that Matthew 27 speaks to us about when
says that: "And the tombs were opened, and many BODIES
of saints who had ASLEEP, GOT UP; AND CAME OUT of the tombs,
AFTER his resurrection, THEY CAME into the holy city, and appeared to
many” [^196], but the Bible does not specify it. What it does show us
this passage is that the dead are asleep, unconscious, and only
they can COME and APPEAR to the living AFTER they LEAVE the
graves, when they cease to be ASLEEP, when they wake up, when
they RISEN, when they resurrect with a physical BODY, be it temporary or
definitely. Not before.

Paul in 2nd Corinthians 5 explains the resurrection, that moment in which
we will be awakened to be present with Jesus Christ, with a
comparison. He says: "we know, that if the earthly house of
our room is undone, we have from God a building, a house
not made with hands, eternal in heaven. And for this we also groan,
desiring to be overdressed in that our heavenly habitation”
[^197]. Paul compares this body to a temporary house that will be
replaced by a permanent one that was made in heaven. this body
will be replaced by a permanent body to inhabit a new earth
with a new sky But meanwhile sleepy.

#### Everyone.

And how am I born to that life eternal life? It is not so easy because according to John 6
Jesus Christ affirms: "No one can come to me, unless the Father who sent me
no” [^198] “drags it first” [^199].

And Jesus Christ explains in John 14: "No one comes to the Father,
but for me" [^200].

In other words, first the Father gives them to Jesus Christ and then for that
way we reach the Father.

So we are in the hands of YHWH. Of the father.

But there is good news because according to John 5, our Lord Yeshua
it states:

“Do not be astonished at this, for the hour will come when
ALL who are in the graves will hear his voice and come out, who
did good for the resurrection of life but those who practiced
evil for the resurrection of” [^201] judgment [^202].

Furthermore, Paul explains in 1 Timothy 2 that God "wills
that ALL men be saved and come to the knowledge of the
truth" [^203] and that Jesus Christ "gave himself in
ransom for ALL, to which testimony was given in due time"
[^204].

And in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul explains that “just as in Adam
ALL die, so also in Christ ALL will be made alive" [^205].

Because as explained in Romans 11: "God shut up EVERYONE under
disobedience to have mercy on EVERYONE" [^206] and that:
"from him and through him and to him are ALL things"
[^207].

And Jesus Christ in Matthew 11 says that: "ALL things have been
delivered by my Father" [^208]. And in John 17 he affirms that: "Well, you have
given your Son authority over ALL men, to give eternal life to ALL
those you gave him" [^209].

And John in Revelation 5 says that: "I heard EVERY creature that is in the
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and which is in the sea, and
ALL things that are in them, saying, To him that sitteth on the
throne, and to the Lamb be blessing, and honor, and glory, and
power, forever and ever" [^210].

And Paul quotes Isaiah 45 in Romans 14 saying, “I swear by my life, it says
YHWH, that before me ALL will bow the knee and ALL will praise GOD "
[^211].

Let us hope that at least after the resurrection of the dead and
that during that eternal judgment that awaits those who did evil,
all those "ALL" include you; and Elohim, YHWH, the creator god
of heaven and earth, don't end up being a liar.


HOME_SCRIPT
### Just.

The justice described in the Bible may be one of the most
difficult to understand or one of the easiest to understand.

It all depends on what we believe before reading the text.

If we believe that physical death IS the end, that there is no resurrection
physics of the dead, is very difficult to understand. But if we believe that
physical death is NOT the end and that there IS a physical resurrection of the
dead, of ALL the dead, and we read the text letting the same
text defines the concepts of good, bad, obedience, disobedience,
life and death is very easy to understand.

#### Justice.

YHWH himself explains through his prophet Ezekiel that:

"If the wicked turn away from all the sins he has committed, and fulfill
all my laws and does what is right and just, he shall surely live and not
will die I will not remember all the bad things he did, and he will live
for doing what is right. I do not want the wicked to die, but
Change your behavior and live. I, the Lord, affirm it.

But if the righteous man fails to act righteously, and does all that is evil and
detestable thing that the wicked does, do you think that he will continue
living? I will not remember all the good things I have done:
he will die because of his infidelity and his sins” [^212].

The thing is easy: He who does good lives. He who does evil dies.

YHWH also explains his justice through Moses. In Deuteronomy 30
tells us that: “Look, I have set before you today life and good,
death and evil” [^213]. And he also says: “To the heavens
and I call the earth as witnesses today against you, that I have made you
before life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose the
life” [^214].

In Jeremiah 17 also YHWH says that: "Deceitful is the
heart more than all things, and wicked; who
meet? I am the Lord, who searches the heart, who tries
kidneys, to give to each according to his way, according to the fruit of his
works” [^215]. And a little later in Jeremiah 18:
“But if these people turn from their wickedness, from
that I will have spoken, I will repent of the evil that I had thought
make them And in a moment I will speak of the people and the kingdom, to
to build and to plant; But if I do wrong in front of my eyes, no
Hearing my voice, I will repent of the good that I had determined to do him."
[^216].

In other words, the thing works for people as well as for nations. Whether
If you do what is good, you live; if you do what is bad, you die.

#### The good.

The question is who does the good?

When the rich young man addresses Jesus Christ as "good teacher" in
Mark 10, Jesus Christ asks him: “Why do you tell me
well? There is none good, but only one, God” [^217]. Consistent with
Paul's explanation in Romans 11: "God shut up ALL under
disobedience to have mercy on EVERYONE" [^218]. And with 1st
Corinthians 15 in which Paul explains that “as in
Adam ALL die, so also in Christ ALL will be made alive"
[^219]. And with Psalm 14 which says: “The Lord looked from
the heavens above the sons of men, To see if there were any
Understood, let him seek God. They all declined, together they have
corrupted: There is no one who does good, there is not even one” [^220].

Thus, according to the bible, sinners, those who do evil, we are ALL,
absolutely everyone since Adam and the consequence is death.
Precisely for this reason EVERYONE needs a savior. not among men
there is no good one, not even one.

And what was that so terrible that Adam did?

In Genesis 3, God tells Adam: "from the tree of the knowledge of good
and you shall not eat of evil, because the day you eat of it, surely
you will die” [^221]. From the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Seek
know good and evil.

From a strictly logical, strictly rational point of view, it is
Impossible to distinguish the good from the bad without knowing the truth. If not
I know the truth, if I don't have access to the truth, how can I
distinguish the good from the bad? Impossible.

Jesus Christ identifies himself as The Truth. He says in John 14
“I am the way, the truth and the life” [^222]. Then without The Truth, without
Jesus Christ, it is impossible to distinguish between good and bad. That is why
Jesus Christ tells us, according to John 8, that: “If you remain in my
word will truly be my disciples; and they will know the truth, and the
truth will set you free” [^223].

If we do not know Jesus Christ, if we do not know The Truth, we are not
Truly free. It is possible to choose, to choose, but it is not possible
choose CORRECTLY. You are not truly free. If you are a slave to
a lie. That physical death is the end. that there isn't one
physical resurrection. We are slaves to sin, we can only "err
objective”, we are not TRULY free.

It doesn't seem like it, but without Jesus Christ what happened to the people of
Israel in the time of the Judges. According to Judges 21, when already having the
commandments and all the law of the Torah, "everyone did
right before their eyes” [^224]. And without Jesus Christ, he follows us
going. When is abortion good? When is it good to change
gender? Is homosexual marriage good? Was YHWH good in sending
Shaul to kill all the people of Amalek? Is the law written in
Deuteronomy? Why don't you ban slavery? We choose, we judge without
The Truth, without Jesus Christ in the heart, and we end up doing the
Judges 21: “each one did what was right in his own eyes”
[^225].

And what we believe as true, as certain, as real, determines the
the way we think, speak and act. priorities, wishes
and the objectives are aligned with what we believe. That is why John
explains in 1st John 2 that: “Love not the world, neither the
things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father
Is not in the. Because everything in the world, the lust of
the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, not
it belongs to the Father, but it belongs to the world” [^226]. The pleasures, the money and the
social power are the priorities of those who belong to the world. Are
they change when Jesus Christ, the Truth, is known. That's why Yeshua
It also says in John 11 that: "I am the resurrection and the
life” [^227].

When you begin to believe in his resurrection, things begin to change.
change. Paul explains in Romans 10 that “if you confess
with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God raised him up
from the dead, you will be saved” [^228]. Believe IN THE HEART, not from the mouth
outside, that Jesus Christ was resurrected, allows the process to begin.

#### The good.

Doing good seems very easy, Jesus Christ explains it, according to Matthew 22:
“You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with
all your mind This is the great and the first commandment. And the second
is like unto him: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. of these two
commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets” [^229]. And he adds,
according to John 13: “A new commandment I give you, that you love one another
to each other. As I have loved you, you also love one another.
to others” [^230].

The thing seems easy. Love God above all things, love your neighbor
like himself, love as Yeshua loves us. Easy. Love, love, love.

To do good is to love.

It is in practice that things are not so easy because according to Matthew 5,
Yeshua makes it a little more difficult than what was written by
Moses. Yeshua says that “You have heard that it was said to the ancients:
You shall not commit murder; and anyone who commits murder will be guilty
at trial. But I tell you that everyone who gets angry with his brother
He will be guilty at trial. Anyone who calls his brother a 'fool'
he will be guilty before the Sanhedrin; and whoever calls him 'fatuous' will be
exposed to the“ Ge-Henna of fire [^231]. And he adds: “You have heard that
it was said: Thou shalt not commit adultery. But I tell you that everyone who looks
a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart” [^232].
Like someone who says that one sins with what is said, with thoughts,
with the feelings, with the heart. It's not just what you do. is it
that comes from the heart. Yeshua explains in Matthew 15 that: “what comes out of the
mouth comes from the heart, and that defiles a man. because of the heart
evil thoughts come out, homicides, adulteries,
sexual immorality, theft, false testimony and
blasphemies” [^233].

Yeshua demands more than the law written by Moses. According to Matthew 5, Yeshua
It requires loving the enemy, turning the other cheek, delivering what they ask,
go the extra mile, be like Heavenly Father who is perfect. Be
holy.

To be good is to be Holy and Perfect like the Heavenly Father.

Those are big words. That is why Yeshua says that he did not come to
annul the law but to complete it. To make it more perfect.

That is why Peter asks him "And then who can be saved?", and
Yeshua replies: "For men this is impossible, but for God
everything is possible” [^234].

#### The bad guys.

The good is God. The good thing is to love as God loves, to be Holy and Perfect.

We have all sinned, we all have sin. All men have done
evil.

And according to the bible, what happens to the one who does evil? What about the
bad? They die. In fact they are already dead. It is precisely to be
spiritually dead, for not knowing Yeshua, who is Life itself,
for not being able to live as Jesus Christ lived, that they cannot do what is good.
And the consequence of spiritual death is physical death. That was
the consequence for Adam and that is the fate of sinners, of all
Adam's descendants.

With the exception of a few of the last generation descended from
Adam, we are ALL going to physically die. Because there is sin in EVERYONE. Is
in the meat itself. In genetics itself. In the one that comes from Adam. There is
a physical spread of evil, through the flesh, and a
spiritual propagation, through the social system, what the bible
calls the world. That is why the bible speaks of a collapsing creation,
drop. Spiritual death is nullable when you begin to know
spiritually to Jesus Christ. And physical death will be nullable AFTER
of the resurrection of the dead. Jesus Christ saves us from death
DRAWING US OUT of death, both physical and spiritual.

Psalm 37 says that the wicked dry up, wither, that they will be
destroyed, that they are going to look for them and they are not going to find them, that
their day, that their sword will enter their own hearts, that they will perish, that
they dissipate like smoke, that they will be eliminated, that they will be exterminated,
that are going to disappear [^235]. Obviously that has not happened yet.
There are still a lot of bad guys out there.

Psalm 9 has a similar tone, it speaks of the destruction of the wicked
for ever and ever. Other psalms calling for or announcing destruction
of the wicked are Psalm 10, 12, 18, 21, 28, 52, 58,
59, 63, 73, 92. In short, there are several psalms that speak of the
destruction of the wicked.

There are several psalms in which the psalmist asks God for suffering
physique of the wicked. Some in tones of revenge and torture. It
which shows us that even psalmists saw themselves as good people, the
bad are the others, and that, according to the bible, it is valid to ask
practically anything to God. Including the suffering of others
people or the death of oneself. It is valid as long as God is asked
and do not think about taking actions for yourself. leave things in hands
of God's justice.

There are several moments in the book of Revelation in which the
destruction of the wicked.

Revelation 11, just after blowing the seventh trumpet, tells us that:
“The nations were angry, but your wrath has come and the
time to judge the dead, and to give their reward to your servants the
prophets and the saints and those who fear your name, both the
small as well as great, and to destroy those who destroy the
earth” [^236].

In Revelation 20 when it says that: “And when the thousand years
fulfilled, Satan will be loosed from his prison, and will go out to
deceive the nations that are in the four corners of the earth,
Gog and Magog, to assemble them for battle; the number of
which is like the sand of the sea. And they went up over the breadth of the
earth, and compassed about the field of the saints, and the beloved city: and from
God came down fire from heaven, and devoured them” [^237].

Revelation 21 says that: “But to the fearful
unbelievers, the abominable and murderers, fornicators and
sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their portion shall be
in the lake burning with fire and brimstone, which is the second death”
[^238].

The point is that God promises to destroy the wicked. that the day will come
They are going to look for them and they are not going to find them.

#### Fire.

YHWH's, God's, favorite way of ending the bad guys is with
fire.

In Genesis 19 it says that: “Then the Lord rained on
Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD from the
heavens” [^239]. In Ezekiel 38: “I will rain on him, and
over his companies, and over the many peoples that are with him,
torrential rain, and hailstones, fire and brimstone” [^240]. in Amos
1 and 2 we see that Jehovah says that: “And I will put fire in the
house of Hazael”, “And I will put fire in the wall of Gaza”,
“And I will put fire in the wall of Tyre”, “And I will put fire in
Temán”, “And I will put fire in Moab”, “I will put so much fire in Judah”. In
Revelation 20 says that “fire came down from God out of heaven, and
devoured” [^241]. Revelation 21 says that: “to the fearful and unbelieving, to
abominable and murderers, fornicators and sorcerers, and
idolaters, and all liars, their part shall be in the burning lake
with fire and brimstone, which is the second death” [^242]. In 2nd Peter 2
says that: "But the heavens which are now, and the earth, are
preserved by the same word, kept for the fire in the day of
judgment, and from the perdition of ungodly men” [^243]. Definitely
God likes fire. And sometimes sulfur.

The Bible also tells us in 1st John 4 that: "He who does not love does not know
goodbye; because God is love” [^244]. And in Hebrews 12:
“For our God is a consuming fire” [^245]. I mean
that God is love and fire at the same time.

And according to Isaiah 9 Jehovah affirms that “for the passion of YHWH of the
armies all the earth is on fire and the peoples are the
fuel. Fire from man to brother leaving no one” [^246]. ALL
the earth. And the PEOPLE are THE FUEL. And the fire spreads from
man to brother! Better said TREMENDOUS FIRE!

The interesting thing is that this is perfectly consistent with the
intentions that Yeshua says he has in Luke 12 when he states that: "I have
come to cast fire on earth. And how I wish he was already
switched on!" [^247]. And with Mark 9 when Yeshua states:
“Because everything will be salted with fire” [^248]. Or is he
arsonist is Jesus Christ!

##### Spiritual.

John the Baptist, according to Matthew 3, explains to us about Jesus Christ that:
“He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor. Pick up
his wheat in the barn and burn the chaff in the fire that never burns.
will turn off” [^249]. In a FIRE that will NEVER go out. Jehovah, in Malachi
3, warns us: “Who can resist the day of his coming? or who
will you be able to stand when he manifests? because he is like fire
purifier and as laundry bleach” [^250].

Jesus Christ himself tells us about the Valley of Hinnom, the Ge
Hinom in Hebrew, from Ge-Henna in the Greek transliteration. Translated
“INFERNO” in Latin and then “INFERNO” in Spanish. A valley where
times of King Josiah, the Hebrews, the Israelites, came sacrificing
their children by passing them through fire to a certain god Moloch [^251]. using said
valley as a reference, Jesus Christ tells us according to Matthew 5 that:
"Anyone who says, Fatuous, will be guilty of" Ge-Henna of fire
[^252], and that: “everyone who looks at a woman to
coveting her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Therefore,
If your right eye causes you to fall, pluck it out and throw it away. Because
it is better for you that one of your members be lost than that all your
body is thrown into the” Ge-Henna [^253]. And according to Matthew 18, Jesus Christ says
that said fire is ETERNAL [^254].

The Son, Jesus Christ, also likes fire to put an end to
bad. And not just any fire but an ETERNAL one. And if he looks greedily, ya
pans.

Jehovah, YHWH, the Father, according to Isaiah 33, says that: “Now
I will rise, says the LORD Now I will be exalted; now i will be
extolled. They conceived chaff and gave birth to stubble. Your breath will be
fire that consumes them. The towns will be completely burned; What
severed thorns will be burned in the fire. You who are far away
hear what I have done; and you who are near, know my power. The
sinners in Zion are afraid; the shudder has taken over
the wicked. Who of us will be able to dwell with the consuming fire?
Who among us will be able to dwell with the eternal flames?” [^255]. No one
wants to live in the middle of a fire that does not go out. Especially the
bad.

And according to Jude 1 the thing has already started because it speaks of the non-believers of the
time in the following terms: "make others saved by snatching them
of fire; and others have mercy, but with caution, hating
even clothing contaminated by their meat” [^256].

On the one hand we have that the Holy Spirit is like a fire, that everything
consumes, which is love, which is transmitted from believer to non-believer, which
will never go out, that burns all peoples and nations, that
transforms the person, which cleanses the person like a fire
purifying, or like bleach that removes stains, that the bad ones fill
afraid and tremble to think of it, that Jesus Christ was the one who
he brought and he is going to set the whole earth on fire. One way to end the
evil is by turning them good through his Holy Spirit. Starting off
of a creature that does evil God makes a new creature that does
the good, transforming the first into the second through its
Holy Spirit.

It is noteworthy that this fire of the Holy Spirit is one that will never be
will turn off Which is eternal.

##### Physical.

On the other hand we have that Sodom and Gomorrah were not consumed by a
spiritual fire, but by a physical one. A physical fire was the one that
it also consumed Tyre, Bozrah, Kerioth, and Jerusalem.

And the fire that Peter talks about in 2nd Peter 3 when he says that:
“The heavens and the earth that now exist are
reserved for fire; guarded until the day of judgment and
destruction of ungodly men” [^257], is a fire that seems to be
very physical because he compares the situation with what happened in times of
Noah. Situation that was definitely very physical.

Furthermore, Peter says that: “the heavens will pass away with great
noise; the elements, burning, will be undone; and the earth and the
works that are in it will be consumed. since all
these things must be undone, what kind of people must be
you in holy and pious conduct, waiting and hastening for the
coming of the day of God! For that day's sake the heavens, being
lit, they will be undone; and the elements, being scorched, will be
melted. According to God's promises we expect new heavens and earth
new in whom justice dwells” [^258]. waste items,
works of the earth consumed, molten elements and then some skies
new and a new land. Of course, a rooster does not sing. something very physical
that ends everything by fire, not by water, so as not to break the
promise that God made to Noah.

If what is described in Isaiah 30 is physical when it says that:
“The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the
sun will be seven times greater, like the light of seven days” [^259], it is
easily understandable that this entire planet is consumed by the
fire. If the moon becomes like the sun and the sun increases its energy 7
Sometimes this planet becomes a ball of fire. and the prophecy of
Zephaniah 1 would be literal: "I will completely end all things
from the face of the earth! saith the LORD. I will finish with the men and with
the animals; I will destroy the birds of the sky and the fish of the sea.
I will stumble the wicked and remove men from the face of the earth.
earth, saith the LORD” [^260].

This moment would be the moment when all the offspring are finished
of Adam. No more sons of sons of sons of Adam. this would be the time
in which a few will not die because they will be directly transformed,
according to Paul in 1 Corinthians 15 [^261].

This moment would correspond to the one described in Revelation 20 when,
Speaking of the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ on earth, he says that:
“When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and
will go out to deceive the nations that are above the four points
cardinals of the earth, Gog and Magog, in order to gather them for the
battle. The number of them is like the sand of the sea. and climbed on
the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the city
beloved, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them” [^262]. would correspond
because after that you don't see this sky and this earth again but a
new heaven and a new earth. A new heaven and a new earth
physical ones, because the spiritual ones are already being built with all the
born again Believers. Those who are going to live in that land
new with that new sky, also physical, when they are resurrected
physically.

Moment also described in Ezekiel 38, when he says that Gog will say to
himself: “I will go up against a defenseless land; I will go to a
quiet people who live confidently. They all live without
walls, and have neither locks nor gates” [^263]. And that in the end everything
ends with: “torrential rain, hailstones,
fire and brimstone” [^264]. Just as the song ends in Revelation
20. It makes sense that if a thousand years of peace, tranquility,
in which one lives confidently, there are no walls or locks.

Moment that is the end, end, of the children, of the children, of the children
of Adam. It doesn't go anymore. No more offspring of Adam. moment that is right
before the resurrection of the dead.

We can conclude that God also likes physical fire to end
with the bad guys. Of course, none of the physical fires he mentions
the bible, and that we know are physical, have been eternal. everyone has
finished. They have all turned off.


HOME_SCRIPT
### Everyone.

By now it should be clear that, to the best of my knowledge, the Bible
teaches that, after the resurrection of the dead, when ALL
dead be resurrected in a new PHYSICAL earth with a new heaven
PHYSICAL, on this same planet, ALL, absolutely ALL
risen will be able to confess with their mouth that Yeshua is Lord, and believe
in their hearts that Yeshua was resurrected, they have it right there in front of them, and
Therefore, those who did not start before their physical death, will begin to be
new creatures in Christ Jesus and eternal Life will begin.

One of the doctrines most rejected by most believers in
Yeshua, in Jesus Christ, is the doctrine commonly known as
“Christian universalism”. In this video it will be called simply
“absolute reconciliation”.

The way I understand the teachings of the Bible is a way of
absolute reconciliation. And since it generates so much rejection, and is so
emphatically pointed out by some as contrary to scripture, I
it seems necessary to make an analysis of the reasons why I believe
Which is exactly what the Bible teaches.

#### Hell.

The word "hell" does not appear anywhere in the older manuscripts.
ancient because these are written in Hebrew and Greek. and this
word is neither Greek nor Hebrew.

##### Jesus Christ.

In the Gospels there are only two Greek words which, in the words
of Jesus Christ, have been translated as "hell": The word G86, the
“Hadés”, and the word G1067, the “Ge-Henna”, according to the code of the Lord
James Strong.

###### Hades. Word G86.

The word G86 sounds "hades", although many people pronounce it
“hades”, and refers to the place where the dead go. The translation
to the Greek of the old testament, of the Tanakh, of the scriptures
Hebrews, known as the Septuagint, a translation made by Hebrews
between 300 and 200 before Jesus Christ, uses this word, the "hades",
to translate the Hebrew word “Sheol” into Greek.

The word "Sheol", the word H7585, means the place where the
dead, i.e. the tomb, the sepulchre, or the sepulchre.

"Sepultura" or "tomb" is precisely the most frequent translation into
Spanish in the Reina Valera of the word H7585 of the Tanakh, with more than 40
occurrences of 64 translated in this way.

Then the most appropriate translation of the Greek word "Hades" would be the
word: "tomb," unless you mean the pagan idea of
the Greeks of an underworld where the Greek god Hades reigns, in whose
In this case, the ideal would be a transliteration of the word.

###### Ge-Henna. Word G1067.

The Greek word G1067 sounds "Ge-Henna" and is a transliteration of the
Hebrew “Ge Hinom” to Greek. "Ge" means valley and "Hinom" is name
own. According to 2 Kings 23 and Jeremiah 7, in the time of King Josiah, the
Hebrews, the Israelites, came sacrificing their children in the valley of
Hinnom passing them through fire to a certain god Moloch, and Josiah, who according to the
Bible was a good king, he finished with the little song.

Then the most appropriate translation of the Greek word "Ge-Henna" would be the
phrase: “Valley of Hinnom”.

#### Sheol. Word H7585.

The first of the two Greek words used by Jesus Christ, according to the
gospels, and translated as "hell", it is "Hades". since
"Hades," in early Greek translations, is simply a
translation of the word "Sheol", this is the first word that is
will analyze.

The Hebrew word "Sheol" of the old testament was translated in the
Septuagint into Greek as "hades" and this was later translated
into Latin as "inferno" and also translated into Germanic languages
as “hel” or “helle” and later translated into English as “hell” and from the Latin
into Spanish as "hell".

The "Sheol" of the old testament, of the Hebrew scriptures, has
certain characteristics that are deduced from the context in which it is used
the word

##### Everyone.

From Genesis 37, it is understood that Jacob, Israel himself, went to
“Sheol” when he died [^265]. From Job 14, it follows that Job, a righteous man
according to the creator himself, he would also go to "Sheol" if he died in that
moment [^266]. From Job 21, the wicked go down quietly to “Sheol”
[^267]. From Psalm 16, 18 and 86, David, the man according to
heart of God, went to “Sheol” when he died [^268].

According to the old testament ALL the dead go to "Sheol",
both those we consider good, and those we consider bad.
ALL the dead go to “Sheol”.

##### Lift.

From 1st Samuel 2, it is understood that YHWH is the one who brings down "Sheol"
and also raises the dead from him [^269]. From Amos 9, no one can
hide in “Sheol” because YHWH takes them out, raises them up, out of “Sheol”
[^270]. From Psalm 16, YHWH does not leave his friend in “Sheol” [^ 271]. Of the
Psalm 30, same, YHWH rises from “Sheol” [^272]. From Hosea 13, YHWH
rescues from “Sheol” and death no longer has a sting [^273].

According to the Tanakh, the Old Testament, the Hebrew scriptures, of the
"Sheol" can be left. It comes out when YHWH takes one out of “Sheol”.
When YHWH raises the person from “Sheol”. Jesus Christ went to Sheol
when he died and left Sheol when he was resurrected.

##### Any.

From 1 Samuel 2, it is understood that there is no life in "Sheol", it seems obvious
but some forget [^274]. From Job 14, in "Sheol" it is not
feel the wrath of YHWH [^275]. From Proverbs 15, there are no thoughts in
the “Sheol” [^276]. From Psalm 6, there are no memories in “Sheol” [^277].
From Psalm 30, there is no life in "Sheol", it seems obvious but to some it is
forgets them [^278]. From Ecclesiastes 9, in "Sheol" nothing is done, nor
one thinks, nor is there knowledge, nor wisdom [^279].

According to the Tanakh, the Hebrew scriptures, in "Sheol" nothing happens,
he's dead, period.

##### Different.

Only by making an analysis of the old testament we see that there are great
differences between what the Bible shows us about "Sheol" and the concept
popular of "Hell".

The current popular concept of "hell" has so many similarities with
the Greek concept of the underworld dominated by the Greek god "Hades",
that it is difficult to think that it is not the same concept. Underworld
which, by the time of the Septuagint translation, had already
adopted the name of the god "Hades" who governed it according to mythology
Greek. This Greek concept is obviously not Hebrew. not a concept
that Jesus Christ used. This concept ends up passing to the Romans in the
Latin word “inferno” and from these to the current popular concept of
"hell".

The concepts were mixed because, at the time, the concept of translation
Septuagint, the best Greek translation of the Hebrew "Sheol" was
"Hades" and the Septuagint translation was the basis for the other
translations.

The word "Hades" is used consistently in the New Testament.
with the concept of "Sheol" of the old testament and NOT with the concept
Greek for “Hades” which of course is NOT Hebrew and would NOT be used by
Jesus Christ, the most Hebrew of all Hebrews.

Some of the verses of the new testament that ratify the concept
of "Sheol" of the old testament, were already mentioned in this
presentation, and they are in the mouth of Jesus Christ.

In John 11 Jesus affirms that: "Our friend Lazarus sleeps but I go to
wake him up" [^280] and then explains "Lazarus is dead" [^281]. In Mark
5 and Luke 8 Yeshua affirms: "The girl is not dead, but asleep"
[^282].

Matthew 27 also uses the same terminology [^283]. And Paul uses the same
terminology in 1 Corinthians 11 [^284] and 1 Thessalonians 4
[^285].

In Acts 2, Jesus Christ comes out of the Hebrew “Sheol” [^286]. Peter quoted by
Luke speaks to a crowd and he quotes King David. the word in
Acts is obviously "Hadesh" but we know from the context that it is
quoting from the old testament the word "Sheol".

It is noteworthy that some would like to put Jesus Christ preaching the
gospel in "Sheol" because of the verse in 1st Peter that says he was
I preach the gospel to the dead [^287], but nowhere in the
context appears the word G86, the "Hadés". And obviously, "the
dead”, in this context, have the same sense that uses the same
Jesus Christ when referring to people who are physically ALIVE but DEAD
spiritually, because otherwise it would not be a Hebrew concept, of
the Hebrew scriptures. And Jesus Christ came to fulfill the prophecies, to
confirm, to fill, to complete, to give FULLNESS, to the writings
HEBREWS. It is evident that Jesus Christ preached the gospel to the dead
because they were all spiritually dead before Jesus Christ.

The new testament ratifies the old. Jesus Christ was in
grave, dead, doing nothing and now he is alive because he came out of the
grave upon resurrection. And, according to Jesus Christ, when he is resurrected it is for
not die because you can no longer die.

The only thing the "Sheol" of the Hebrew scriptures has in common with the
popular "hell" is that both have dead, but they are not even the
same dead.

#### Ge-Henna. Word G1067.

The second and last of the two Greek words used by Jesus Christ,
according to the gospels, and translated as "hell", it is the "Ge-Henna".

The Ge-Henna, that is, the valley of Hinnom described by Jesus Christ in 11
verses from the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and named a
time in the letter of James, the one that ended up being translated as
"hell", has a series of characteristics that are deduced by the
context in which the word is used.

##### It's fire.

From Matthew 5 [^288], from Matthew 18 [^289] and from Mark 9 [^290], it is understood
That valley is of fire. The valley of Hinnom of which Jesus Christ speaks is
of fire.

##### It does not turn off.

From Mark 9 [^291], it is understood that it is from a fire that does not go out. In
this chapter makes clear the biblical reference to Isaiah 66 [^292]
because it uses the same terminology. In Hebrew it is the phrase “does not quench”.

##### Lifetime.

From Matthew 18 [^293] and Mark 9 [^294], it is understood that entering the
Life and being placed in this valley are two exclusive things. We too
indicates that before being able to enter Life it was impossible to be thrown into
this valley. And let us remember that our Lord says “I am the way, the
truth and the life” [^295], he is the Life, before Jesus Christ he was
Impossible to enter Life. Then before Jesus Christ, it was impossible
put someone in this valley.

##### God's Kingdom.

From Mark 9 [^296], it is understood that entering the Kingdom of God and being placed
in this valley are two exclusive things. It also tells us that before
to enter the God Realm it was impossible to be thrown into this valley.
When Jesus Christ sends out 70 of his disciples, in Luke 10, he
says “Heal the sick who are there and tell them: 'The
kingdom of God has drawn near to you'” [^297], in Luke 11, he tells
those who accused him of obtaining his power from Beelzebub, who:
"If by the finger of God I cast out demons,
surely the kingdom of God has come to you” [^298], in Luke 17,
"When the Pharisees inquired of him as to when the
kingdom of God answered them, saying, The kingdom of God will not come with
caveat. They won't say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There it is!' Because the
kingdom of God is in your midst” [^299]. And Paul saying goodbye to
those of Ephesus says "And now, behold, I know that none of
all of you, through whom I have passed preaching the kingdom of God, will see
plus my face” [^300]. Before Jesus Christ the Kingdom of God had not
arrived, then before Jesus Christ it was impossible to put someone in this
Valley.

##### Eternal.

From Matthew 18 [^301], it is understood that the fire of that valley is eternal.
Here the word is G166 [^302], “aiónios”, which is the same used
for eternal life.

##### Everyone.

From Mark 9 [^303], it is understood that everyone will be salted with the same
fire of that valley.

##### Judgment.

From Matthew 23 [^304], it is understood that a judgment is executed in that valley.

##### Before.

From Matthew 23 [^305], from Mark 9 [^306] and from James 3 [^307],
understands that at the time of Jesus Christ there were already people who were affected
down that valley and didn't even know it. She was already acting. She acts from
before physical death. And therefore since before the resurrection
physical.

##### Later.

From Luke 12 [^308], it is understood that this valley also acts after
physical resurrection.

##### The worm does not die.

From Mark 9 [^309], it is understood that in that valley the worm does not die. In
this chapter makes clear the biblical reference to Isaiah 66 [^310]
because it uses the same terminology. The worm of Isaiah 66 is the
word H8438 [^311] that refers to the “coccus-ilicis” that was used
both for medicinal purposes and to prepare a scarlet dye.
This word appears in almost all the cloth parts of the tabernacle of
Moses and in the clothing of the priests of the tabernacle [^312]. It is
also the word used in psalm 22 [^313] quoted by our Lord
on the cross. And it is the same with which, in Isaiah 41, God calls "worm"
to Jacob [^314]. Tabernacle, priest clothes, Jesus Christ, Jacob.
All the same “worm” from Isaiah 66.

Paul in 2nd Corinthians 5 [^315] compares our body to a tent,
with a tabernacle, because just as the presence of God was in the
tabernacle of Moses, the Holy Spirit lives in the body of the
believers. He also compares it to a dress that is clothed in purity
Holy Spirit.

These observations allow us to conclude that the "worm does not die"
refers to the body of the person who is in that valley. The valley is NOT
cause of death of the person's body, of physical death.

##### Destroyer.

From Matthew 10 [^316], it is understood that there is a person who can use
that valley to destroy body and spirit. The word for destroy is
the G622 [^317] which is not only used in the sense of “kill” but also
in the sense of being ruined, or lost. For example it is used in Matthew
15 when our Lord says that “I am not sent but to
the LOST sheep of the house of Israel.” [^318]. Here obviously
these little sheep is not that they have been killed but that they are "destroyed",
“ruined”, “degraded”, “lost” in perdition. that valley
destroys, ruins, ends, degrades body and spirit but NOT in a
irreversible because “the worm does not die”.

##### Different.

Taking all the characteristics of the Valley of Hinnom, the most
important thing with the popular hell is that the valley of Hinnom only acts
over those who are PHYSICALLY ALIVE. Either before or after the
physical resurrection but only acts on LIVING people who have a
physical body.

It obviously has several features similar to those of the popular
“hell”: it is made of fire, that fire does not go out, it is eternal, it executes a
judgment, it also acts after the resurrection and is destructive. But
it only acts on physical beings and the destructive effect is reversible.

This concept of the Valley of Hinnom that we see reflected in these
features also has other differences from the popular
“hell”: it acts from before physical death, it only exists since
Jesus Christ began to preach the Kingdom of God, and the fire that forms it,
room, splash, to ALL physically alive but dead
spiritually.

It is similar but different. This is a spiritual concept with effects
physical, such as sin, which is also a spiritual concept with
physical effects.

This concept is perfectly consistent with what was observed when
spoke of divine justice: with the intentions that Yeshua claims to have
in Luke 12 when he states that: “I have come to cast fire on earth. Y
How I wish it was already on!” [^319]. That said, the arsonist
it is Jesus Christ.

John the Baptist, according to Matthew 3, explains to us about Jesus Christ that:
“He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
His fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor. Pick up
his wheat in the barn and burn the chaff in the fire that never burns.
will turn off” [^320]. Jehovah, in Malachi 3, warns us: “Who can
resist the day of his coming? or who can stand when he
manifest? Because he is like a purifying fire and like lye
washermen” [^321].

This fire divides those who are initially saved from those who
they are initially condemned. Paul explains it in 2nd Corinthians 2 of the
as follows: “Thank God that he always leads us in the parade
victorious of Christ and who through us makes known his
message, which spreads everywhere like a pleasant aroma.
Because we are like the smell of incense that Christ offers to
God, and that it spreads both among those who are saved and among those who
they are lost For those who get lost, this incense is an aroma
mortal, but for those who are saved, it is a fragrance that gives them life.
And who is qualified for this? We are not negotiating with
the message of God, as many do; On the contrary, we speak with
sincerity before God, as his envoys that we are and by our
union with Christ” [^322]. In this case the fire is compared to an aroma,
for some mortal, for others fragrance of life.

It is a fire that kills the bad guys, it kills some before death
physical and others after the physical resurrection, because
“Many first will be last, and many last will be
first” [^323].

God's love is a consuming fire, his Spirit is a fire of Life,
that consumes death, a fire of Truth, that puts an end to lies, a
Holy fire, which ends sin. If I resist that fire, if I
attachment to my spiritual death, to my lie, to my sin, is going to
destroy, it will ruin me, degrade. If I join that fire, I become
part of it and I will have Life, Truth and Holiness. Or as Jesus Christ says in
Matthew 16: "For whoever wants to save his life
will lose, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” [^324].

Once this fire is done with each one of us, the only thing
What will we see of the sinner, of the one who rebelled against God, of the dead
spirit that was sprinkled with this fire of life when he heard the
good news of the resurrection, the only thing we will see will be the body
of that person, of the deceased, and the memories of that person.

Once that fire does the hot update, without stopping
function, of the operating system, of the person, the only thing that will remain of
the old person, from the old operating system, would be his memories and the
body it inhabited.

That fire will be that new operating system, that new holy person, that
Holy Spirit, in the image and likeness of Yeshua HaMashiakh, of our
savior Jesus Christ. A fire that will never stop burning. And if the
update does not end before physical death, it just continues
after the physical resurrection.

Once the update is finished, the only thing we can do is
look at that body, remember what that person did, shake your head and
think "how horrible". Or as Isaiah 66 says: “And they shall go out, and
shall see the corpses of the men who have rebelled against me: for their
worm will never die, nor will its fire be quenched; and they will be abominable to all
meat” [^325]. TO ALL flesh, including mine, already resurrected.

Neither the popular hell, nor the popular heaven, exist in the scriptures,
in the bible thought in Hebrew. But we can say that the valley of Hinnom
it is: a hell for the bad guys and a heaven for the good guys; a hell
for the one who is lost and a heaven for the one who is saved; hell for
the one who denies Jesus Christ and a heaven for the one who accepts him. and none
son of Adam starts out good, saved, or holy.

Either I am fire or I burn. And no child of Adam starts out fire.

#### Eternal death.

There is not a single verse in the bible, neither in Hebrew nor in Greek.
that has the phrase "eternal death". Nothing, none, zero. Does not exist
no verse that has the sequence in Greek of the words G2288,
thanatos, death, followed by G166, aiónios, eternal. Nor is there any
verse that has the sequence H4194 H5769 or H4193 H5769, the possible
sequences for "eternal death" in Hebrew. None, nothing, zero. not one
ONLY verse.

The emphasis is on ETERNAL LIFE. 37 verses in the New Testament
they have the phrase in Greek "ETERNAL LIFE", that is to say the word G2222, zoe,
followed by the word G166, aiónios, and more than 50 verses refer to
that life, to LIFE in Christ Jesus, to eternal life, sooner or later
of the resurrection of the dead.

Even the only verse in which the phrase "eternal punishment" appears, in
some translations of Matthew 25, it is arguable that it means a
punishment in the normal sense of the word, but a correction. That what
it is with fire.

In the Greek the word translated as "punishment" or "torment" is the
word G2851 kolasis. Kolasis means correction according to the code
Strong. In addition, it comes from the word G2849 kolazó, which some
scholars argue that it was used for the word “prune”, as when
a tree is pruned. Which reminds me of the burning bush that I don't know
consumes that Moses saw. That is to say, the phrase, arguably, is
should translate as "eternal correction." The one with fire.

In any case, the sequence G2851 followed by G166 only appears in one
verse. ONE verse in the entire New Testament. a single
verse for the Greek phrase that some translate as "punishment
eternal".

The other word used to denote God's punishment is the word
G3709, orgé, which translates “anger”. This word followed by the word for
eternity, the G166, does not appear even once in the entire New
Will. The "eternal wrath" in the Greek New Testament does not appear
not once, nothing, ZERO. On the contrary, in several parts of the
The Bible tells us that the wrath of God lasts only an instant, a
moment and that God is very slow to anger. and various parts of the
The Bible tells us that God's mercy and love is ETERNAL.

The emphasis in the New Testament is on ETERNAL LIFE and ETERNAL LOVE.

#### Eternal punishment.

Psalm 37 says that the wicked dry up, wither, that they will be
destroyed, that they are going to look for them and they are not going to find them, that
their day, that their sword will enter their own hearts, that they will perish, that
they dissipate like smoke, that they will be eliminated, that they will be exterminated,
that are going to disappear [^326]. And Psalm 14 says that: “The LORD looked
from heaven over the sons of men to see if there were any
sensible to seek God. But they had all gone astray; to one
they had corrupted. There was no one who did good; there wasn't even
one” [^327]. The mechanism by which God makes all things new
it is by means of an eternal fire, the fire of his Holy Spirit. The good
ends evil, love ends hate.

Although the biblical punishment for those who do evil, for the wicked, is the
death, the bible does NOT speak of an "eternal death" or a "punishment
eternal” for that wicked one. "Eternal death" is NOT the phrase used by the
bible to refer to what happens to the wicked because
Jesus Christ came, died and rose again just to get us out of death,
both the spiritual and the physical. There is death and there is punishment, only
they are not eternal.

But LET'S ASSUME, LET'S ACCEPT, LET'S BELIEVE, that YES, that when the bible says that
the bad ones dry up, wither, that they will be destroyed, that they will
search and they will not find them, that their day is coming, that their sword
will enter their own heart, that they will perish, that they dissipate like the
smoke, that they will be eliminated, that they will be exterminated, that they will
disappear, it refers to the fact that they die eternally and that is their punishment
eternal.

Let us see how one can understand an eternal destruction, a death, between
quotation marks, “eternal”, a punishment, in quotation marks, “eternal”, in the context
of what the living God promises: an ETERNAL LIFE.

The destruction, the disappearance of the wicked, of the one who is already dead
spiritually, of that which is dying physically, that destruction
definitive, total and ETERNAL, begins when you are born again, when that
evil, that spiritual dead, is made a new creature by the Father
Celestial, and the spiritual dead begin their ETERNAL destruction. Not anymore
the wicked live, the spiritual dead, because their destruction began
eternal, thus suffering its PUNISHMENT, in quotes, "eternal". now live
Jesus Christ in him and began the ETERNAL life of the NEW CREATURE. Christ
that lives in that new creature begins to live eternal Life in the
eternal fire of the Holy Spirit that destroys, ends, disappears, vanishes,
nail the sting of death into the wicked, into the wickedness that was in
the spiritual dead leading him to his ETERNAL destruction, to his PUNISHMENT,
in quotes, "eternal".

At the moment of being born again, the old self, the evil one, begins its
final journey to eternal destruction, and the new me, the new creature,
begins his final journey to an eternal life. That trip is in the middle of the
eternal fire, and the old me, the evil one, will not like it, but the new
I, the good one, will like it more and more. In the end, that wicked man stops
exist because it suffers eternal punishment, is eternally destroyed, and all
person, the entire NEW CREATURE is transformed into, the Good, the
Holy, the Worthy, the Deserving, Jesus Christ Himself, in that body of the old
I.

Transformation is a process where not everything is burned and not everything is
turned. The new creature is born in the old creature and grows until
completely transform it into the new creature.

In some believers in Yeshua, the part that will be transformed is
precisely the one who believes that the Creator of heaven and earth that
he changed his heart of stone for one of flesh, so that
wanted to repent of his sins, and seek, and choose, and
accept Jesus Christ, and thus be able to love his Creator above all
things, that this Creator, who also created all the others, was left
great, or it will be great, to transform the hearts of others who
they have also refused to accept it, or choose it, or seek it at a time
dice. That part will suffer the eternal punishment of the fire of the valley of Hinnom
that will destroy her forever. That part will suffer, in quotes, “a
eternal death," when the believer, either before or after his
physical resurrection, be aware of the falsity of what you believed.

The evil that we have inside, that enemy of God that we have inside,
is being transformed into a new creature, NEW eye, by the
spirit of the living God who now lives in every believer, that if he can
believe that ALL of us will be transformed, because he is going to see it with his
own eyes: we are going to see each other again and embrace as brothers in
Jesus Christ. That is the biblical promise of the God who does not lie.

#### Lake of fire.

The lake of fire, mentioned in the last chapters of the book of
revelation, is a third option that is commonly related to the
popular "hell". Interestingly this lake has NEVER been translated as
hell. Neither in the first translations nor in the modern ones. The reason
is that the Hebrew word "Sheol" is the true origin of the
appearances of the word “Hades” in the Greek translations of the
Hebrew scriptures, now known as the Old Testament, for its
appearance in the Septuagint from before Jesus Christ. And when I know
the new testament wrote in Greek this word, the "Hadés", never
it was the “limné-tou-pyros”, that is, the lake of fire. Hades was the
“Hadés” and the “limné-tou-pyros” was the “limné-tou-pyros”. Never was
opportunity for them to mingle.

So why did the lake of fire also end up being a popular
"hell"?

According to the book of revelation, the man is thrown into the lake of fire.
false prophet, and the beast or monster, and the Satan or dragon or devil or
ancient serpent, and death is thrown, and Hades is thrown,
that which comes from "Sheol", or grave, and are also thrown
partially, or as the bible says "they will have their share", cowards,
the unbelievers, the abominable, the murderers, the fornicators, the
sorcerers, idolaters and liars.

It looks like it, but it isn't.

The bible narrates that "Sheol" and death will be thrown into this lake.
This fact tells us that it is a spiritual concept, not a physical one.

This lake of fire is the "eternal punishment", in quotes, for the
evil, death and the grave. It is the end of the grave. Is the end
of death, that is to say that there is no more death, neither spiritual nor physical.

The lake of fire is the second death for those who were still dead
spiritually, those who had died physically but the destruction
eternal of his wickedness has not ended. So it's already started
process.

The only ones who are not affected by this second death are the first
resurrected, those who were already fully alive physically and
spiritually. Those who had already suffered the eternal destruction of
their wickedness and that is why they were the first fruits, the first to be
resurrected. This second death does not affect them because they are already
fully alive both physically and spiritually. and let's remember
who is resurrected so as not to die because one can no longer die.

The first resurrected are a few. 144 thousand saints, men, all
Israelites, descendants of Abraham, who reigned with Christ for a thousand
years, from Jerusalem in the temple described in the book of Ezekiel.
Temple to be built at the beginning of the thousand years, when I return
our Lord. They are a FEW because many are called but few
the elect of Abraham's descendants. A few who will not have
relations with women during those thousand years, because they are already
resurrected and the women who live during those thousand years are not
still risen. It is a forbidden cross between two kinds of bodies
different.

The rest, you and I, who are not descendants of Abraham, after
the thousand years and after the resurrection of the dead: pal laguito de
fire, sooner than later, at least in part. For more believer,
follower and disciple of Yeshua that you believe, however registered in the
book of life, my brother HAS SIN, he has at least a lie, and
that part of him goes to the lake of fire in chapter 21, if not
they sent it complete in chapter 20 of the book of Revelation.

Only until the end will all things be known and that is what the lake is for
of fire, to purify all those little lies, purifying them as
purifies the silver: to the FIRE. And the fire BURNS. It's exactly the same
fire of Ge-Henna, of Ge Hinom, of the valley of Hinnom. Either you are fire or you
burning. And no one starts out as fire.

After the resurrection of ALL the dead, when we meet
with all those who hurt us and with all those we did to
damage we will have to admit what we did. At that time it will be
It is impossible to deny the Truth, to deny Jesus Christ, to deny reality. And how
they say "The truth hurts", or in this case BURN.

It is the absolute reconciliation before the impossibility of denying our
lie, our spiritual death, our sin. and that little fire
BURN, end evil. Kill that evil, that spiritual dead
that we are you and I without the FIRE of the Holy Spirit.

#### Excluded.

According to the Reina Valera 2015 translation, in 2nd Thessalonians 1, the
wicked “shall be punished with eternal perdition, EXCLUDED
from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power” [^328], but according to
the Reina Valera 1909 translation, that is, exactly the same version
of translation, but only about a hundred years ago, the bad guys ”will be
punished with eternal perdition BY the presence of the Lord, and BY the
glory of his power” [^329]. That is to say that in 2015 they are “excluded”
of the presence and in 1909 it is precisely BY the presence, they are in the
presence. Completely the opposite.

Which one do we believe? It is in these cases when you have to resort to the most
close to the originals [^330].

This is the only case, the only verse in the entire Bible, in which
the word G575, the word “apo”, which literally means “of”,
mysteriously in the vast majority of translations of 2 Thessalonians
1, appears accompanied by words that are not in the original Greek.
Words like “excluded”, or “separated”, or “thrown away”, or
"far" or "away". In the original there is no word that
correspond to nothing like it.

In the more than 650 occurrences, LISTEN WELL more than 650 occurrences, in the
Greek of the word G575, the word that means “of”, there is NO
another that the same thing happens to it: that without any modifying word that
accompanies is translated as “excluded from”, or “separated from”, or “thrown
far from".

For example in Acts 19 when it says that "More
some hardening and not believing, cursing the Way before
the multitude, departing from them, Paul separated the disciples” [^331],
Paul "departs from" them, and in the Greek the word G868 appears, which
It means precisely "to move away", or "to move away", to modify the "of" and
indicate this separation.

The same happens with every other occurrence of the word G575. When
translates "beware of" is the word G4337 modifying the G575, when
translates "far from" is the word G3112 or G4206 modifying it,
when translated "deliver us from" is the word G4506. and so with all
the other occurrences.

In 2 Thessalonians 1 when translated “excluded from” [^332] the only
modifier word is the word G3639, which means “ruin”, or
"destruction". That is to say that the literal translation would be: “destruction
eternal from the presence of the Lord.” It is the presence of the Lord that
destroy forever. However, in some translations it appears
mysteriously the word “excluded”, which would be the word G1576, or
a combination of the word G1544 with the G1854. But these words do not
appear nowhere in the original Greek of the verse in question
of 2 Thessalonians 1. It is the ONLY case in the more than 650 occurrences
something like this happens.

This situation is a sign that: no matter how well-intentioned
a translation, the preconceptions, the prejudices, of the translator
are reflected in the translation.

And thanks to the fact that YHWH is pouring out his spirit on all
peoples and nations using the Internet, now anyone can interpret
correctly the first language to learn to interpret: the
language in which our Lord Jesus Christ thought, spoke and prayed, his
followers and ALL the authors of what is now known as the New
Testament when they wrote it: the same as the Old Testament. The
The second thing to learn to interpret is the language in which
finally finished writing. Both are relatively easy to
interpret using the Internet and some other open program. Both
necessary for the Holy Spirit to enable you to understand, discern,
interpret, what Paul explains not only in this case, very important,
but also with respect to other cases that are also very important, such as the case
of "speaking in tongues." This way we avoid ending up “spinning in longas” or
"trampling the tongues", as some do, and believing that what they do
it's biblical. The problem is not in what they do but in believing that it is
biblical.

Thus, between these two translations of the Reina Valera, the translation that
best reflects the meaning of the verse in Greek is that of the Queen
Valera Antigua 1909: the wicked “will be punished with eternal perdition BY
the presence of the Lord, and BY the glory of his power” [^333]. will be
punished “FOR” the presence, “FOR” the glory of God. that punishment
it comes “FROM” his presence, “FROM” his glory.

This is completely the OPPOSITE of the sense that most of the
translations in most languages. It is precisely IN the presence
and IN his glory the punishment is given.

God shows up and his presence destroys evil. overcome evil with
kindness as Paul says. In the presence of the FIRE of the Holy Spirit the
evil of a person is destroyed and this becomes a Ge-Henna of FIRE
for that evil, it becomes a lake of FIRE for the evil that dwells in
the physical body of that person. And the fire BURNS. Before or after
physical resurrection of the person, but BURN.

Either I am fire or I burn. And no child of Adam starts out fire.

#### The rich and poor Lazarus.

The famous parable of Jesus Christ known as "The rich and the poor
Lazarus,” found in Luke 16, is popularly cited as a
example of what the popular hell and popular punishment is literally like
eternal [^334].

Some observations for those who know or are interested
in reading it:

1. The parable is addressed to some Pharisees, who because of what he tells them
    Jesus Christ it seems that they liked to repudiate their wives and
    marry multiple times.
2. The authority in the parable is not YHWH, the Heavenly Father, but
    Abraham. Who those Pharisees were proud to be
    decendents.
3. The parable ends by saying: “But Abraham said to him:
    If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if
    someone shall rise from the dead” [^335].
4. The parable cannot refer to a time after the
    resurrection of the dead because the rich man's brothers follow
    physically alive. And therefore much less at a later time
    to the final judgment that follows the resurrection of the dead.

That is to say that the whole parabola is nothing more than a parallel in which the
The rich man represents the Pharisees, the poor Lazarus the pagans, and the
The rich man's brothers are the Jewish followers of the Pharisees. He is a
announcement of Jesus Christ to the Pharisees of what was going to happen to them: that
they would not believe in the one who is going to rise from the dead, that is
Jesus Christ himself, the one who speaks, and that this will lead to a separation
abysmal with those who did believe in him, most of them pagans who were
despised by those Pharisees, those spiritual poor represented
for Lazarus.

A separation like the one experienced by the Jews and the Pharisees who did not
they believed in their Meshiakh and the pagans who did believe in Jesus Christ. The
pagan ends up being an Israelite in the bosom of Abraham, just as
Paul explains in Romans 11, and the Pharisee expelled from God's people
living a spiritual equivalent to the Greek "hades" for almost 2000 years.

This is the only passage in the bible where the word G86, hades, does not
it is used in the Hebrew sense of "Sheol." The explanation is that this
parable is an adaptation that Jesus Christ makes of a popular tale
Greek, which in turn is an adaptation of a popular Egyptian tale,
to make a prophecy to some rebellious Hebrews. Prophecy that has been
fulfilled in the last almost 2000 years.

#### Free will.

From a strictly logical, strictly rational point of view, it is
Impossible to distinguish the good from the bad without knowing the truth. If not
I know the truth, if I don't have access to the truth, how can I
distinguish the good from the bad? Impossible.

Jesus Christ identifies himself as The Truth. He says in John 14
“I am the way, the truth and the life” [^336]. Then without The Truth, without
Jesus Christ, it is impossible to distinguish between good and bad. That is why
Jesus Christ tells us, according to John 8, that: “If you remain in my
word will truly be my disciples; and they will know the truth, and the
truth will set you free” [^337].

If we do not know Jesus Christ, if we do not know The Truth, we are not
Truly free. It is possible to choose, to choose, but it is not possible
choose correctly. You are not TRULY free.

Paul further explains in Romans 9 [^338]: “And not only
this, but also when Rebekah conceived of a man, Isaac
our father, and although his children had not yet been born nor had
done right or wrong-so that God's purpose depended on his
choice, not of works but of the one who calls—she was told, “The
the older shall serve the younger,” as it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau
I abhorred What then shall we say? Is there injustice in God? From
no way! For he says to Moses: I will have mercy on whoever has
mercy, and I will pity those who pity me. For that reason, not
it depends on the one who wants or on the one who runs but on GOD who has
mercy. Because the Scripture says to Pharaoh: For this very thing you
I raised, to show in you my power and so that my name may be proclaimed
for ALL the earth. So that whoever WANTS, has mercy;
but who LOVES, hardens. Then you will tell me: "Why still
blame? For who has RESISTED her will? First of all, oh
man, who are you to contradict God? Will the glass say
formed to the one who formed him: "Why did you make me like this?" Or does he not have
authority the potter over the clay to make a vessel from the same mass
for honorable use and another for common use?

As who says the thing depends is on God, not on one. not that i
choose God but he chooses me, and thanks to that, later I
I can choose him.

In Exodus we see that it is YHWH who hardens Pharaoh's heart.
Ever since Exodus 4, when Moses hadn't even gotten to Egypt to see
to Pharaoh, just after it seemed that God was making
terquito to Moses, YHWH says to Moses: "When you are back in
Egypt, do in the presence of Pharaoh all the signs that I have set in
your hand. However, I will harden his heart, and he will not let go of the
town” [^339]. Then the bible repeats us 8 times, almost one by
plague, that “I will harden Pharaoh’s heart” [^340] and that “the Lord
hardened Pharaoh's heart” [^341], so that the thing remains
clear. It is YHWH who hardens Pharaoh's heart.

In Jeremiah 24, Jehovah promises that: “I will give you a heart
so that you may know me, for I am the LORD. They will be my people, and I
I will be their God, because they will return to me with all their hearts” [^342]. in Jeremiah
32, Jehovah promises that: “I will give you one heart and one
I only walk, so that they may fear me perpetually, for their own good and
for the good of their children after them. I will make a pact with them
eternal; I will not give up doing them good. I will put my fear in the heart of
them, so that they do not depart from me” [^343]. In Ezekiel 36, YHWH
promises that: “I will give you a NEW heart and put a NEW spirit
inside of you. I WILL REMOVE the heart of stone from their flesh and GIVE them
a heart of meat I will put my Spirit within you and I WILL make
walk according to my laws, that they keep my decrees and that they put them by
work” [^344].

It is Yahweh who changes the heart. He puts his spirit within us and
He makes us obey his laws.

And you will tell me, what can YHWH blame man if no one can resist?
at your will? And God himself answers us in Isaiah: "How they upset
things! Will the potter be considered like the clay? does it
that has been made will say of the one who made it: 'He did not make me'? will say what
has been formed from him who formed him: 'He has no understanding'?” [^345]
“Woe to him who contends with his Maker, being nothing but a piece of
POT among the POTTS of earth! Will the clay say to the one who shapes it:
'What are you doing?' or 'Your work doesn't have handles'?” [^346].

He is the one who is doing us, he knows what he is doing and he does it in accordance
at your will. Or whatever he wants, period. Don't claim. Thanks.

Paul explains in Romans 8 that "the creation has been subjected to the
vanity, not by its own will, but because of him who
fastened, in hope” [^347]. It is because of the potter. then also
explains, in Romans 11, that: “God shut up ALL under disobedience
to have mercy on ALL” [^348].

Fortunately, Jesus Christ came to set the captives free. paul in
Ephesians 2 explains that: "thanks be to God because, although they were slaves of the
sin, have obeyed from the heart that form of teaching to which
have given themselves and, once freed from sin, have been made
servants of justice” [^349].

He who is a slave to sin is not free. We were slaves to sin. The
who is born again is born into the slavery of Jesus Christ, into the gentle yoke of
Jesus Christ becomes a slave of his own free will, after
They changed the heart so that he could do it, he becomes a slave of La
Truth and this makes you free, TRULY FREE.

Some Jews, according to John 8, tell Jesus Christ that: "We are
descendants of Abraham and we have never been slaves to anyone. How
you say: 'They will become free'? Jesus answered them: 'Verily, verily.
Truly I say to you that everyone who practices sin is a slave to
sin'” [^350] “So, if the Son sets you free,
they will be TRULY free” [^351].

Without Jesus Christ that "free will" is not so "free". I didn't even
we can choose him without the intervention of the Father, that is why the same
Yeshua, according to John 6, assures that "No one can come to me, if the Father
who sent me no” [^352] “drags it first” [^353].

Heavenly Father drags us in first, changes our hearts, and then
if we can choose Jesus Christ. Jehovah himself announces it to us from the
principle: “The LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the
heart of your descendants, that you love the LORD your God with all your
heart and with all your soul, so that you may live” [^354]. he us
circumcise the heart, thanks to that we can repent, return to
God, choose Jesus Christ, receive him who is Life itself, and live
eternally in union with the living God.

Jesus Christ tells us, according to John 8, that: “they will know the truth, and the
truth will set you free” [^355]. He is the truth. Thus, freedom
TRUE freedom, is proportional to that knowledge of the truth, of
Jesus Christ. The more we know Jesus Christ the more truly free
we are. But TRUE will be that free will. And no one is born knowing
Jesus Christ, you have to be born again to begin to know him. There
true Life begins, the eternal in Christ Jesus.

#### Bible.

A majority of Christians, those who believe that "Christ was killed
for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and
that he was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures” [^356], ACCORDING
TO THE SCRIPTURES, they also believe that there is physical torment, conscious and
eternal for a part of humanity.

Everything in the believer's life must be ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES. So
Let's see what the scriptures teach of an absolute reconciliation.

##### Adam.

The creation was finished in 6 days because on the 7th God rested. He says
Genesis 1 that: “And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was
good in a big way. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day” [^357]. Y
Paul explains in Colossians 1 that by Christ "ALL the
things that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and
invisible; be thrones, be dominions, be principalities, be
powers; EVERYTHING was created by him and for him. And he is before ALL
things, and by him ALL things hold together” [^358]. this obviously
includes Adam and his offspring. He adds that: “it pleased the Father that in
he might inhabit all fullness, and by him reconcile all things unto himself,
pacifying by the blood of his cross, so what is on earth as
what is in heaven” [^359]. Jesus Christ reconciles ALL things
himself, not just part, not just a small percentage, not just a few
how many chosen PLEASED the Father through Jesus Christ to reconcile ALL the
stuff. The solution is much bigger than the problem. Paul explains it
in Romans 5 “But not as the crime, such was the gift: because if by the
crime of that one (ADAM) the many died, MUCH MORE ABOUNDED the
grace of God to many, and the gift by grace to one man,
JESUS ​​CHRIST” [^360]. Jesus Christ, the solution, is much bigger than the
problem: Adam. Why did grace abound so much more? Well, because the
raw material of Jesus Christ are a hand of sinners and lost in the
perdition that he transforms into saints and righteous through his Spirit
Holy, while Adam was one and very well made, according to his
creator himself, and who sinned because the Ancient Serpent, the Satan, deceived
his companion Eva, they took him by his weak point. the solution is much
bigger than the problem. And if the problem brought down EVERYONE, the
solution also promises to transform EVERYONE. 1st Corinthians 15: “so
As in Adam ALL die, so also in Christ ALL will be
quickened” [^361].

##### Abraham.

The promise that YHWH makes to Abram in Genesis 12 is that:
“In you all the families of the earth will be blessed”
[^362]. This was when Abram was 75 years old and still had no children. Later
promises him a son and as time passes and nothing happens, Abram decides
help God and has Ishmael with his wife's slave. and Jehovah,
in Genesis 18, just before destroying Sodom with fire falling from the
heaven, confirms his plan: “in him they shall be blessed
ALL the nations of the earth” [^363]. But he wasn't born yet
Isaac. And it also seems that Sodom is not part of that "ALL"
nations and families of the earth. In Genesis 22, he confirms the promise
to Abraham when Isaac was already young and he almost killed him by order of
Jehovah. Clarifying that it is in his seed that "they will be
Blessed are ALL the nations of the earth” [^364]. Years later, when
Isaac was already married, God repeats the promise to Isaac in Genesis 26
“In your offspring all nations shall be blessed.
the earth” [^365]. And to Jacob, who would later be called Israel, being
young and still single, but having stolen his blessing,
read inheritance, to his older brother, Jehovah also speaks to him and tells him
“In your descendants all the families of
the earth” [^366].

Families, nations, ALL. But that same God is the one who later sends
Saul kill even the cat, literally, of the descendants of Amalek,
that is, that family is not part of that "ALL". Sure
are not the only ones, there are also the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the
Canaanite, Hivite, Jebusite, and a few other families and nations that
nor do they seem very blessed by that same God who promises to bless
ALL families and nations, because throughout history ordain
destroy them and ERASE them from the face of the EARTH. And if its inhabitants go
to suffer a conscious, permanent and eternal torture, for the centuries of
the centuries, after the resurrection of the dead, because that is what
doesn't sound like a blessing.

The problem is the same as Adam's, trying to eat from the tree of
KNOWLEDGE of good and evil without knowing the TRUTH, without knowing
Jesus Christ. And to know Jesus Christ is to live with Him and in Him. But everything
begins by believing in Him. Jesus Christ is a descendant of Jacob, of Israel,
who is the grandson of Abraham, the one of the promise. And if Jesus Christ rose,
EVERYONE is going to rise on the last day and by it ALL the things of the
heaven and earth will be reconciled. “In you all will be blessed
the families of the earth” [^367].

##### Moses.

Moses writes in the book of Genesis about Jacob and Esau that: BEFORE
before they were born, God had already decided that “the eldest will serve the
minor” [^368]. And that it is written "I loved Jacob, and Esau
hated” [^369]. Before neither Jacob nor Esau had done anything
good or bad, God had already decided. God decides BEFORE that
things happen.

Moses writes in Exodus 4 that: when Moses had not even gone out to
Egypt to see the Pharaoh, YHWH has already announced that the Pharaoh: "does not
he will let the people go” [^370]. because "I will harden Pharaoh's heart"
[^371]. YHWH has already decided to harden Pharaoh's heart so that
don't let the people go. God decides BEFORE things happen.

And Paul explains to us in Romans 11, “For God shut up
ALL under disobedience to have mercy on ALL. oh
depth of the riches, wisdom and knowledge of God!
How incomprehensible are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
Because: Who understood the mind of the Lord? Or who became his
adviser?. Or who has given to him first to be rewarded
for him?. For from him and through him and to him are ALL things. A
he be the glory forever. Amen” [^372]. It was God himself who
locked up EVERYONE in disobedience. God decides BEFORE they happen
things.

Jehovah announces from the beginning what happens at the end, because he already
he knows it and decided it from the beginning.

In Deuteronomy 29 and 30, another of the books written by Moses, YHWH
announces that after Israel conquers the promised land and
obey, he will become disobedient, and that after he disobeys, he,
Yahweh will scatter them, cast them out, and banish them through all the
nations of the earth, and that after they repent, being
in all these nations and peoples, he will gather them again even when
were in the farthest parts under the sky [^373].

That is to say, Moses writes what Jehovah commands him to announce: all the
history of Israel from Moses to 1948 when he did exactly that and
YHWH formed the present nation of Israel in one day. thing that was
unimaginable just some 200 years ago to anyone who did not believe in
the creator God of heaven and earth.

And just after announcing all this, in the same Deuteronomy written
by Moses, YHWH, God, tells us that: “The LORD your God
circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants, so that you love
to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that
alive” [^374]. Who is he who circumcises the heart? Jehovah. Jehovah is
who changes hearts So that? So that they obey him and live. Y
What does he announce later, also in Deuteronomy 30? what:
“You will listen again to the voice of the LORD, and you will put
do all his commandments that I command you today” [^375]. Funny
undeserved. Undeserved gift. For love of himself. the same as he did
with the pagans by giving us his Holy Spirit through the death of
Jesus Christ on the cross.

"God locked ALL under disobedience to have mercy on
ALL” [^376] through his son Jesus Christ.

In the end everything will be as announced from the beginning. like that bush
fire that Moses saw. We will be branches of a bush, of a vine
true, burning with the holy fire of the Holy Spirit, which is not
quench, that burns for all eternity, and that sanctifies us to be one
in the Son and in the Father.

We did not choose YHWH, it was HE who chose us from the
beginning. He was the one who loved us first, ALL, all, all.

##### Psalmists.

Throughout all the Psalms, the biblical teaching exposed
in this video.

Psalm 37 says that the wicked dry up, wither, that they will be
destroyed, that they are going to look for them and they are not going to find them, that
their day, that their sword will enter their own hearts, that they will perish, that
they dissipate like smoke, that they will be eliminated, that they will be exterminated,
that they will disappear [^377].

Psalm 9 has a similar tone, it speaks of the destruction of the wicked
for ever and ever. Other psalms calling for or announcing destruction
of the wicked are Psalm 10, 12, 18, 21, 28, 52, 58,
59, 63, 73. In short, there are several psalms that speak of the
destruction of the wicked.

There are others who tell us about the mechanism. It is by fire that the
silver. Psalm 66 says of the people of Israel that: “Because
You tested us, O God: Test us as silver is refined. Us
you put in the network; You put tightness in our loins. men did you
climb on our head; We entered FIRE and waters, and brought us out
full” [^378]. And Psalm 21 says of the enemies of God that:
“Your hand will reach out to all your enemies; your right hand
will reach those who hate you. Put them like a furnace of FIRE in the
time of thy wrath: the LORD shall destroy them in his wrath, and FIRE
will consume. You shall destroy his fruit from the earth, and his seed from among the
sons of men” [^379]. Psalms 18, 29, 50, 68, 83, 89, 97,
104, 140 [^380] and others refer to YHWH's fire that destroys
the wicked and the enemies of God. Let us remember we are ALL,
because there is no good one!

And what is the result of said destruction? Psalm 45 says that:
“I will make the memory of your name perpetual in ALL
generations: For which the peoples will praise you forever and forever.
always” [^381]. And Psalm 22: “Remember they have, and
ALL the ends of the earth shall return to the LORD; and they will humble themselves
before you ALL the families of the nations” [^382]. And Psalm 47
“ALL peoples, clap your hands; Shout out to God with a shout of joy."
[^383]. And Psalm 65 “You hear the prayer: It will come to you
ALL FLESH” [^384]. And Psalm 67: “Praise you peoples,
Oh God; Praise all peoples” [^385]. And Psalm 72
“And kneel down unto him ALL kings; they will serve you
ALL peoples” [^386]. And Psalm 96 “Sing to the Lord
new song; Sing to Jehovah, ALL the earth” [^387]. And Psalm 97
"The heavens denounced his justice, AND ALL peoples saw his
glory” [^388]. And Psalm 98 “Sing for joy to the Lord,
All the land; Raise your voice, and applaud, and salmead” [^389]. And the
Psalm 99 “The Lord is great in Zion, and exalted above
ALL peoples” [^390]. And Psalm 102 “Then
The nations shall fear the name of the LORD, AND ALL the kings of the earth
your glory” [^391]. And Psalm 117 “Praise the Lord,
nations ALL; ALL peoples, praise him” [^392]. And Psalm 136
“He gives maintenance to ALL FLESH, For forever is
his mercy” [^393]. And Psalm 145 “The praise of
Jehovah will speak my mouth; And bless ALL FLESH his holy name for ever and
forever” [^394]. And Psalm 148 “The kings of the earth and ALL
towns; The princes and ALL the judges of the earth” [^395]. Goes
being clear? Or we have to read all the psalms. It's ALL MEAT. That
is the promise.

Obviously this can only be fulfilled after the physical resurrection
of ALL the dead. Otherwise it would be “few”, or “some”, or the
"majority", or "all" of a given moment, and not all, all, ALL,
those who have lived, are alive and will live physically in this
planet. And everyone, everyone, EVERYONE is what the God of EVERYONE promises,
everyone, everyone.

##### Isaiah.

The song in Isaiah 25 says that: "And the Lord of hosts will do in
this mountain to ALL the towns a treat for the fattened, a treat for
purified, from thick marrow, from purified liquids. and will undo in
this mount the mask of the coverage with which ALL the
peoples, and the covering that is spread over ALL the
people. WILL DESTROY death FOREVER; and the Lord will wipe away all
tear from ALL faces: and he shall take away the reproach of his people from ALL
the earth: for the LORD has spoken. And it shall be said in that day: Behold
this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us; this is Jehovah
whom we have waited for, we will rejoice and rejoice in his health.”
[^396].

Treat purified, first purifies us. It will undo the mask, the
lie that covers all peoples. Will destroy death forever
and then will wipe away every tear from ALL faces. And then we'll enjoy
and we will rejoice in his Yeshua, in his Savior. That is the Hebrew word.

In Isaiah 52 “The Lord hath made bare the arm of his holiness before
the eyes of ALL peoples; and ALL the ends of the earth will see the
health of our God” [^397]. And that health is the word Yeshua, the
proper name of our savior Jesus Christ in Hebrew. All the
ends of the earth will see Yeshua.

In Isaiah 40 “And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and ALL
MEAT will see it together; that the mouth of the Lord spoke” [^398].

Another way of spiritually saying exactly the same thing is in Isaiah
9, where Jehovah states that “for the passion of Jehovah of hosts
the land is on fire and the towns are the fuel. fire of
man to brother without leaving anyone” [^399]. These types of statements
spiritual causes interesting reactions, Isaiah 33 tells us that:
“Sinners were astonished in Zion, awe seized
to the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
Who among us will live with the eternal flames?" [^400]. An
gigantic valley of fire A Ge-Henna of fire. A lake of fire.

Of course, this can only happen if what Isaiah 26 affirms is true, and
only until it is fulfilled, that: “Your dead will live;
together with my dead body they will rise again. Awake and sing, you dwellers
of the dust! because your dew, which dew of vegetables; and the earth will cast
the dead” [^401]. After the earth casts its dead. Later
of the resurrection of the dead. And then yes, when those dwellers
wake up from the dust, sing and praise their Savior. because he tells us
Jehovah in Isaiah 45 that: “Look unto me, and be saved, ALL
the ends of the earth: because I am God, and there is no other. for me i did
oath, from my mouth came a word in justice, and it will not be revoked. What
To me EVERY knee shall bow, EVERY tongue shall swear. And say of me:
Surely in the Lord is justice and strength: unto him shall they come, and
ALL who rage against him will be put to shame” [^402]. I mean
EVERYONE, everyone, everyone will bend the knee, of their own free will, for love of the
that saved them.

##### Jeremiah.

In Jeremiah 24, Jehovah says that: “I will give you a heart so that you may know me,
for I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
God; for they will turn to me with all their hearts” [^ 403]. And in Jeremiah
31 Jehovah also says that: “I will put my law in his bowels,
and I will write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they
they shall be by people” [^404]. And in Jeremiah 32 Jehovah says:
“I will give them a heart, and a way, so that they will fear me
forever, that they may be well, and their children after
they. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not return
behind doing them good, and I will put my fear in their hearts,
let them not depart from me” [^405]. As who says first YHWH gives a
heart, he writes his law on the heart, he gives a way, he puts his fear in the
heart, and THEN, man can turn, repent, obey,
love YHWH. It is Jehovah who makes one want to do
All those things.

After that, in Jeremiah 33, Jehovah promises that: “And I will cleanse them from
ALL their wickedness with which they sinned against me; and I will forgive ALL your sins
with which they sinned against me, and with which they rebelled against me. and it will be to me
me by name of joy, praise and glory, among ALL peoples
of the earth, who will have heard ALL the good that I do them; and they will fear and
they will tremble at ALL the good and at ALL the peace that I will make them” [^406].

First he himself cleanses us from ALL the evil with which we sin and
THEN He forgives us ALL our sins. And above all it gives us so much peace
and it does us so much good that ALL the peoples of the earth will tremble with
all the good and all the peace that it will bring us.

To think that Adam shot all humanity but Christ only reconciled,
or only saved, or could only attract a few, because the rest did not
accepted, or did not trust him, is like thinking that a mother who decides
change diapers to her newborn baby, because she pooped, after
change your mind and decide not to change it, or it's too big for you to change it,
because your baby started crying, or because you kicked him, or because
I piss her off in the process. It is thinking that the will of the baby will win
at the will of the mother. And of course the comparison is an exaggeration
because proportionally the will of God is incomprehensibly more
bigger than ours, and a mother's just one more time
bigger than the baby's. And God's love for us is also great
larger than that of the mother for her baby.

He is in control, Jehovah is God of everything. He owns the sky and
the earth. EVERY knee will bow because he is going to give us a heart that
he wants to double it for love of him.

##### Ezekiel.

Jehovah says in Ezekiel 11 that: “I have given them a heart, and
I will give a new spirit into her entrails; and I will remove the heart of stone from
their flesh, and I will give them hearts of flesh; So that they walk in my ordinances,
and keep my judgments and fulfill them, and be my people, and I be
them by God” [^407]. And in Ezekiel 36 he says that: “And
I will give a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; Y
I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh, and I will give you a heart of
meat. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
commandments, and keep my rights, and do them” [^408]. Y
In Ezekiel 37 it says that: "And I will put my spirit in
you, and you shall live” [^409]. It is Jehovah who gives a heart capable of
walk in their ordinances. He removes the old heart of stone and gives us
a new one of meat. Then he puts his spirit on us and it is Jehovah who DOES
that we walk in his commandments and do them.

The Bible likes to repeat to make things clear.

It also tells us about the mechanism. In Ezekiel 22 it says that:
“As one who joins silver and metal and iron and lead and tin
in the middle of the furnace, to kindle FIRE in it to melt; so you
I will gather in my wrath and in my wrath, and will make rest, and will melt you. I
I will gather and blow on you in the FIRE of my wrath, and in the midst of
him you will be melted. As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so
you will be melted in the midst of it; and you will know that I, the Lord, have poured out
my anger against you” [^410]. It is with fire. The same one from which we
John the Baptist speaks.

##### Daniel.

In the vision of Daniel 7, a son of man "was
given dominion, glory and kingdom, so that ALL peoples, nations and
tongues served him; his dominion is eternal dominion, which will never pass away, and
his kingdom one that will not be destroyed” [^411]. It says ALL, but some
they believe that it is a part, a majority, a selection, but not all.
Some believe that there is no Sodom, or even all of Israel,
only part. And according to this same vision at the end, "the
kingdom, and the dominion and the majesty of the kingdoms under ALL heaven,
be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is a kingdom
eternal, and ALL dominions shall serve and obey him” [^412]. Is all,
everyone, everyone.

But some believe that it is the kingdom of some, that there are domains that do not
will do, that love does not overcome hate in some cases. that goodness
does not defeat evil in some cases. That the will of some is
greater than that of the creator of heaven and earth. He did not want. of bad
There if God can't do anything.

It is like thinking that a barely crawling baby heading for a
fire and that I, loving father of the baby, warned him and pointed out the
fire, I warn him of the danger, but the baby is still on his way to the fire
and he doesn't understand me, or he doesn't want to understand me, or he doesn't pay attention to me, or he doesn't
obeys me, and then I in my "great love" for my baby and my "great
respect” for his decision and for his will, I decide to let him follow his
path. I love him so much that I let him get into the fire. Absurd
right?, but that's what some believe.

Of course it is not a fair comparison, because God allows us even
die, and then resurrects us ALL. And he gives his Spirit to ALL of us.
Of course not all at the same time, some who were the first will be the
last and others who were last have been first. some later
of the physical resurrection.

##### All 12.

Hosea 6 says that “Come, let us return to the Lord: that he
caught up, and will heal us; he wounded, and he will bandage us. will give us
life after two days: on the third day he will resurrect us and we will live
In front of him. And we shall know, and continue to know Jehovah: as
the dawn is prepared for its departure, and it will come to us like the rain,
like the latter and former rain to the earth” [^413]. But no, some
they think that this is only for Israel and not for the millions of pagans
that we end up believing in the Meshiakh of Israel. And in Hosea 13 “Of the
hand of the grave I will redeem them, I will deliver them from death. Oh death, I
I will be your death and I will be your destruction, oh tomb” [^414]. and Paul
explains in 1 Corinthians 15 that this text refers to the resurrection
of the dead and life in the Holy Spirit. The one that is for EVERYONE.
As YHWH himself explains in Joel 2: “I will pour
my Spirit over ALL FLESH” [^415]. ALL MEAT.

And in Obadiah the same Yahweh says "near is the day of
Jehovah above ALL peoples” [^416]. No one escapes, he explains it to us
also Jehovah in Amos 9 “Though they dig down to Sheol,
there my hand will take them. If they go up to the heavens, from there I will make them
go down. 3 If they hide on the top of Carmel, there
I will find them and take them. Although they hide from my eyes at the bottom of the
sea, there I will send the serpent and it will bite them” [^417]. And he tells us that
when he builds the fallen tabernacle of David he does
“so that those upon whom my name is called
possess the rest of Edom, and ALL the nations” [^418]. in Micah
it also says that “Hear, ALL peoples; she is attentive, earth, and how much there is
in you; and the Lord God, the Lord from the holy temple of him, be a witness
against you For behold, the LORD comes out of his place, and will come down and
shall tread the heights of the earth. And the mountains will melt under
him, and the valleys shall cleft like wax before FIRE, like the
waters running off a precipice” [^419]. Fire is for EVERYONE. In
Nahum 1 states “The mountains quake at his presence, and
the hills melt; The earth is moved at his presence, and the
world, and ALL who dwell in it. Who will stand before his
gonna? And who will be left standing in the heat of her anger? Her anger spills
like FIRE, and by it the rocks are split” [^420].

But some think "that's not with me", "that's for others", "I
I am very good because Christ lives in me”, and “I accepted it”, and “I
I decided”, and “I looked for it”, and they seem to forget that it is not about what
they do or do not do but what God does in them.

In Zephaniah 1, Jehovah tells us that “I will destroy
completed ALL things on the face of the earth, saith the Lord.
I will destroy men and beasts; I will destroy the birds of the sky and the
fish of the sea, and I will cut off the wicked; and I will scrape the men off the
face of the earth, saith Jehovah” [^421]. That's why we are creatures
news in Christ Jesus. Either before or after the physical resurrection
of ALL the dead. Because the old is destroyed physically and
spiritually and forever. ETERNALLY. That's why in Zephaniah 3
affirms that “I will restore purity of lips to the peoples,
so that ALL call on the name of Jehovah, so that they may serve him as a common
consent” [^422]. By mutual agreement. For your own good. Who
does the matter? Jehovah restores purity of lips. What for the
bring back? That they may call on the name of Jehovah. Who? EVERYONE.

The Bible likes to repeat. So that things are clear.

In Haggai 2 we are told that: “For thus saith the Lord of
armies: In a little while I will shake the heavens and the earth, the sea
and dry land; and I will shake ALL nations, and the
Desired of ALL nations; and I will fill this house with glory, he said
Jehovah of hosts. Mine is the silver, and mine is the gold, saith the Lord
of the armies. The last glory of this house will be
greater than the first, saith the Lord of hosts; and I will give peace in
this place, saith the Lord of hosts” [^423]. How many? ALL. Y
will give what? Peace. But no. It just can't be. There must be some mistake. That
some think. finally what? Do we believe the scriptures or not?

In Zechariah 9, speaking of a just and saving King who comes humble
riding on a donkey, white is hen puts it, tells us that:
“His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the river to the
ends of the earth” [^424]. And no, he doesn't say ALL, but he says even
PURPOSES.

And in Malachi, also speaking of his Meshiakh, he tells us that: “And who
will be able to bear the time of his coming? or who can stand
when he shows up? Because he is like purifying FIRE, and like
laundry soap” [^425]. And he reaffirms in Malachi 4 that: “For I have
here comes the day burning like an oven, and ALL the proud and ALL
those who do evil will be stubble; that day to come will burn them, ha
saith the LORD of hosts, and will leave them neither root nor branch” [^426].

Jehovah using the 12 minor prophets, returns and repeats the same
idea. They are ALL, all, all.

##### Jesus Christ.

In Matthew 5 and in Luke 6, Jesus Christ tells us not to get angry, not to look
with greed, not divorce, if you say "yes" let it be "yes" and if you say
“no” let it be “no”, of not resisting the bad guy, of turning the other cheek, of
deliver not only the tunic that they want to take but also the mantle,
to carry two miles the load that he was forced to carry one mile, if
They ask you to give, not to refuse to lend, to love the enemy, to pray for
those who persecute him [^427], to do good to him who hates them, to
bless the one who curses them, to pray for the one who mistreats them, not to
ask someone to take what is theirs, to lend without expecting profit
[^428]. And he explains that “so that they be children of their Father
which is in heaven, because he makes his sun rise on evil and
good, and makes it rain on the just and the unjust. Because if
love those who love them, what reward will they have? don't they do the same
also the publicans? And if they greet only their
brothers, what do you do more? Do not the Gentiles do that?
Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father who is in
heaven is perfect” [^429]. Perfect like their Father. Not only is it
what he asks of us is also what he himself does. God loves his enemies,
God turns the other cheek, God goes the extra mile, God gives if
ask, God gives more than what they want to take away.

Why do some think that God does not do what he requires of his creatures?
That God does not love his enemies, that which was every believer before being
believer? Or that they were NEVER enemies of God? because NOBODY
It starts with being a friend of God.

Jesus Christ in Luke 15 asks us "Which man of you, having
hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, he does not leave the ninety-nine in the
desert, and goes after the one that is lost, UNTIL he finds it?” [^430].
Jesus Christ, in John 10, tells us that "I am the good
Shepherd; the good shepherd the life of him GIVES for the sheep” [^ 431]. He affirms us
that he would do just that: look for the lost sheep, that lost in the
PERDITION, until he finds it. Eye UNTIL you find it.

That is why he also affirms, in John 12, that: “And I, when
raised from the earth, I will draw ALL to myself” [^432].

If God says EVERYONE is EVERYONE.

Jesus Christ affirms in Matthew 11 that: “ALL things have been
delivered by my Father” [^433]. And in John 6, Jesus Christ affirms that:
“ALL that the Father gives me will come to me; and whoever comes to me NEVER
I will kick out Because I have come down from heaven not to do the
my will but the will of him who sent me. And this is the will
of the one who sent me: that I lose NOTHING of EVERYTHING he has given me”
[^434].

EVERYTHING was given to him and the will of the one who sent it is that he not lose
NOTHING of EVERYTHING that was delivered. And EVERYTHING the Father gives him will go
him and will NEVER kick him out.

But no, there are some who say they believe and love the heavenly Father, and
have chosen, and chosen, and trusted, on their own, but that of
that "EVERYONE", that if not, that if it can not be. because they think the
will of the CLAY POT will win over the will of the POTTER!

Fortunately YHWH is not a God of confusion.

##### Pablo.

If it is true that while we were still sinners, Christ died for
us [^435], if it is true that we were slaves of the
sin [^436], dominated by the spirit that controls those who disobey
to God [^437], if it is true that it is not by works so that no one can boast
[^438], and that from the vile of this world and from the despised he chose
God, and what is not, to undo what is, and what is foolish
God chose the world to shame the wise; and the weakness of
God chose the world, to shame the strong [^439]; if all that
What Paul says is true, if you really believe it: Who do you think you are?
what you were before you became a Christian, or what you did, or did to
trust, or what you regretted, or what you
decided, or achieved, or chose, or accepted, or sought, to deserve that the God
creator of Heaven and Earth CHOSE you to believe in his
Son Jesus Christ and accept him before physical death? Don't you think that
The same God who chose from the worst of this world can also
choose when he pleases the one who has not yet chosen?
Even after the physical resurrection of ALL the dead?

Because that is what Paul is talking about.

1 Timothy 2 says that God wants “ALL men to be saved, and that
come to the knowledge of the truth. Because there is a God,
likewise a mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; The
who gave himself a ransom for ALL, as a testimony
in his time” [^440].

1st Corinthians 15 says that “as in Adam ALL die, so also
in Christ ALL will be made alive” [^441].

Romans 11 says "because God shut up ALL in unbelief, that he might have
mercy of ALL” [^442]. And he adds “because of him, and through him, and in him,
are ALL things” [^443].

Ephesians 1 says "by way of a plan for the fulfillment of
the times: that in Christ ALL the
things, both those that are in the heavens and those that are in the
earth” [^444]. And he adds “ALL things God has put under his feet.
and made him head over ALL things” [^445].

Titus 2 says "because the grace of God which brings salvation to ALL
men” [^446].

1 Timothy 4 says “for we hope in the living God,
who is the Savior of ALL men, ESPECIALLY those who
they believe” [^447].

Philippians 3 says "which will transform the body of the
our humiliation, that it may be like unto his glorious body,
by the power with which he can also subject himself to ALL
things” [^448].

Philippians 2 says "so that in the name of Jesus
bend EVERY knee of those in heaven, and on earth, and
under the ground” [^449].

Colossians 1 says "because it pleased the
Father that in him all fullness dwell, and through him RECONCILE
I get ALL things, both those that are on earth and those that
they are in heaven, making PEACE through the blood of their cross”
[^450].

Romans 5 says "just as Adam's crime brought ALL
men, so also the righteous act of Jesus Christ makes EVERYONE righteous
men that they may have life” [^451].

Romans 14 says, “As I live, saith the Lord, ALL
knee, and EVERY tongue shall confess to God” [^452].

Ephesians 4 says "He who went down is the same who also ascended by
above ALL the heavens to fill ALL” [^453].

##### Peter.

In 1st Peter 4 it says “Beloved, do not be surprised at the testing FIRE that
it has happened to you, as if something strange had happened to you” [^454]. Y
adds “if anyone suffers as a Christian, do not be ashamed,
but glorify God for it. 'Cause it's time that
the JUDGMENT begins with the house of God; and if you first start with
us, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of
God?" [^455]. The fire, that of the Ge-Henna, that which they translated
"hell" is for everyone, don't be surprised by that. The trial, that of
Ge-Henna, that which is translated "hell", begins with the believers, for
God's House. Only that for the believer, neither to the fire, nor to the judgment,
it is called Ge-Henna, but it is called the Holy Spirit. This is so,
because the effect is the opposite. In the case of the Holy Spirit it is Life
and Life in abundance.

Of course, the fire is not only spiritual. In 2nd Peter 3 it says that "the day
from the Lord he will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass
with a great noise, and the burning elements will be destroyed, and the
earth and the works that are in it will be burned. Since all
these things must be undone, how should ye not walk in
holy and pious way of life, waiting and hastening for the
coming of the day of God, in which the heavens, being set on fire, will be
undone, and the elements, being burned, will melt! But we
We await, according to his promises, new heavens and a new earth, in the
which justice dwells” [^456].

According to Jesus Christ, after the resurrection we will be like the angels
[^457], and according to Daniel 3 [^458] and Judges 13 [^459], the body of the
angels is resistant to physical fire. So an eternal physical fire is
the least of a revenant's worries. In that new land with
that new heaven, we will ALL have a body like that of the angels, that
said Jesus Christ.

What if everyone who does not believe in Jesus Christ should worry about,
all those infidels, all those unjust, all those wicked, is of that
spiritual fire that promises to destroy them, finish them, disappear them,
vanish them, to the point that they are going to look for them and they are not going to find them
[^460]. "Because whoever wants to save his life will lose it,
and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” [^461].

This earth and this sky will pass away. It's in that new land with that sky
where ALL will be made alive, both physically and
spiritually. That is what Peter expects and what he should expect
every believer in Jesus Christ.

In 2nd Peter 3 it says that: the Lord "does not want anyone to perish but
may ALL proceed to repentance” [^462]. Why do some believe
that their "want" to remain spiritually dead is greater than the
"want" of YHWH? The only explanation is that they are still partially
dead, spiritually, to The Truth.

God does not save by avoiding death. God saves BY RAISING US out of death.
Some bring them out of spiritual death first, so that they can be
repent, and then brings them out of physical death. And others take them out
first from physical death and then brings them out of spiritual death,
so that they can repent. But a is EVERYONE, everyone, everyone, who
He brings us out of both physical death and spiritual death.

##### John.

Revelation 4 says that: “Lord, you are worthy to receive
glory and honor and virtue: because you created ALL things, and by your
will have being and were created” [^463].

In Revelation 5 John says that “And I heard EVERY creature that
is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and
to ALL things that are in them, saying, 'To him who sits on the
throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power
forever and ever'” [^464]. But some imagine
"EVERY creature" does not include the majority of men, because the
most will be somewhere else saying who knows what. like who says
the stars YES, because "ALL things" includes the stars, but
the one who didn't want NO. Because they believe that the will of the CLAY POT
will win at the will of the POTTER!

Revelation 15 says: “Who will not fear you, O Lord, and
will make your name great? because you are only holy; therefore ALL the
Nations will come and worship before you, because your judgments are
manifested” [^465].

Revelation 21 says: “He who sat on the throne
He said, 'Behold, I am making ALL things new. And he said: “Write, because
these words are faithful and true'” [^466]. He makes new ALL
things. New creatures. Ones that can carry out the will of the
creator. And these words are FAITHFUL and TRUE.

#### It is written.

It is written: "The Father loves the Son, and gave ALL things into his hand"
[^467].

It is written: “ALL things were made by him; and without him NOTHING
which is done, was done” [^468].

It is written: “Through the Son, whom he made heir
of ALL, by whom also he made the universe: Who being the
splendor of his glory, and the express image of his person, and
upholding ALL things by the word of his power” [^469].

It is written: “ALL things you have put under his feet. Because in
As he subjected ALL things to him, he left NOTHING that is not subject to him.
[^470].

So far very few believers in Yeshua, Jesus Christ; would argue that
these verses “ALL” means “ALL” and that “ALL” means “ALL”
and that “NADA” means “NOTHING”.

It is written: Jesus Christ “is the image of God
invisible, the firstborn of ALL creatures. Because they were raised by him
ALL things that are in heaven, and that are on earth,
visible and invisible; be thrones, be dominions, be principalities,
be powers; EVERYTHING was created by him and for him. and he is before
ALL things, and by him ALL things hold together: and he is the head
of the body that is the church; he who is the beginning, the firstborn of
the dead, so that in EVERYTHING it has primacy. Because he pleased the
Father, that in him all fullness dwell, and through him RECONCILE ALL
things to himself, making peace by the blood of his cross, so what is in the
earth as that which is in heaven” [^471].

In this text from Colossians 1, some believers would begin to think that
“TODO” means “ALL” and that “TODAS” means “ALL” except in the
last “ALL”. Because if that "reconcile" is of ALL things, that
would include ALL creatures, and that would include ALL sinners.
And that would be too much.

It is written: “Christ has risen from the dead; first fruits of which
they slept is done. For since death entered through a man,
also by a man the resurrection of the dead. Because just like in
Adam ALL die, so also in Christ ALL will be made alive. Plus
each one in his order: Christ the firstfruits; then those who belong to Christ,
at his coming. Then the end; when he will deliver the kingdom to God and the Father,
when he will have removed ALL empire, and ALL power and authority. Because it is
he must reign, until he has put ALL his enemies under his
feet. And the last enemy that will be undone will be death. Because
ALL things he subjected under his feet. And when he says: ALL
things are subjected to him, of course he is excepted who subjected to him
Everything. But after ALL things were subjected to him,
then also the same Son will be subject to him who subjected him to him ALL
things, so that God may be ALL things in ALL” [^472].

But no. In this text from 1 Corinthians 15, some believers have to
start juggling so that “ALL” means “SOME” or
“FEW” and “ALL” means “SOME” or “FEW”. And of course they
are included in those “SOME” or “FEW”.

It is written: "God shut up ALL in unbelief, to have
mercy of ALL. Oh depth of riches of wisdom and
of the science of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments, and
His ways past finding out! For who understood the mind of the Lord? either
who was your adviser? Or who gave him first, that it be
paid out? For of him, and through him, and in him, are ALL things.” to him be
glory for ever and ever [^473].

But no. Some believers believe that in this text from Romans 11, the
Most of the glory goes to someone else.

It is written: The Father of glory showed his power “in
Christ, raising him from the dead, and placing him at his right hand in the
heaven, ABOVE ALL principality, and power, and might, and lordship, and
(ABOVE) EVERY name that is named, not only in this age, but even in the
to come: And he put ALL things under his feet, and gave it up
head over ALL things to the church, which is his body, the
fullness of Him who fills ALL things in ALL” [^474].

It is written: “ALL that the Father gives me will come to me; and the one to me
comes I will NEVER throw him out. Because I have descended from heaven not for
do my will but the will of him who sent me. And this is the
will of the one who sent me: that I not lose ANYTHING of EVERYTHING that he has
given, but raise him up on the last day. This is my will
Father: that EVERYONE who looks to the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and
may I raise him up on the last day” [^475].

It is written: “As you have given him the power of ALL
flesh, that he may give eternal life to ALL whom you have given him” [^476].

It is written: God “wants ALL men to be saved” [^477].

It is written: Jesus Christ “gave himself as a ransom for
ALL” [^478].

It is written: The Lord “does not want ANYONE to be lost
but that ALL proceed to repentance”[^479].

It is written: “ALL flesh shall see the salvation of God” [^480].

It is written: “Sing to the Lord, ALL the earth! Advertise from day to day
his salvation” [^481].

It is written: “The Lord has revealed the arm of his holiness before the
eyes of ALL nations. ALL the ends of the earth will see the
salvation of our God” [^482].

It is written: “ALL the ends of the earth have seen the victory of
our God” [^483].

It is written: “The glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and ALL flesh
he will see it together” [^484].

It is written: Jesus Christ knew “that the Father had given him ALL
things in the hands” [^485].

It is written: Jesus Christ said: “When I am lifted up from
earth, I will draw ALL to myself” [^486].

It is written: ”we work hard and fight, because
We hope in the living God, who is the Savior of ALL
men, ESPECIALLY those who believe” [^487].

It is written: God's plan is that: "in Christ they be gathered under one
head ALL things, both that which are in heaven and that which are
they are on earth” [^488].

It is written: “God also highly exalted him, and gave him
a name that is above ALL names; So that in the name of Jesus
bend EVERY knee of them that are in heaven, and of them that in the
earth, and of those under the earth; And EVERY tongue confess that
Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” [^489].

It is written: Jehovah says “by myself I HAVE SWORN IT; came out of my mouth
word in righteousness, and it shall not be revoked: that shall bow before me
EVERY knee, and EVERY tongue shall swear” [^490].

The Creator God of Heaven and Earth SWEARS by himself in Isaiah and
Paul reminds us in Romans:

It is written: “I SWEAR ON MY LIFE, says the Lord, that before me ALL
they will bow the knee and ALL will praise God” [^491].

Why do some think that the victory of Jesus Christ on the Cross is
as a victory of a roman caesar? What at the end of time
some resurrected will have to bend that knee against their will,
it's going to be like when the older brother bends the younger brother's arm and
force him to say something? It's like imagining the newly risen
forced to bend the knee against his will and to Jesus Christ saying:
“Who is the king of kings? Who? WHO? Who is the winner? AHA !
Now PAL HELL!”

That is NOT the victory of Jesus Christ in ANY of his subjects. Everyone
those of us who have him as King do it of our own free will after
the Heavenly Father exchanges our stone heart for a tender one
that I may love him above all things for our own good. That was
his promise and he is keeping it.

It is written: “And I heard EVERY creature that is in heaven, and on the
earth, and under the earth, and which is in the sea, and ALL things
that are in them, saying, To him that sitteth on the throne, and to him
Lamb, be the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the power, to
always ever” [^492].

Anyway. We could end up studying the whole Bible. The point is that the
promise is for everyone. Obviously that hasn't happened yet because
Those who think that the thing is only for a few would no longer exist,
among which, of course, are themselves.

In addition, the promise of physical and spiritual resurrection is for everyone and
that has not happened either, however that is the promise of the living God,
of the Creator of Heaven and earth: EVERYONE, ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE. And God
he is not a man to lie.

THIS is the good news. The really GOOD NEWS.


HOME_SCRIPT
### The return.

According to the Bible, Jesus Christ announces that he is going to return and in the same
moment when his disciples see him for the last time, two men, two
angels, dressed in white remind them of the same.

In Acts 1, after the crucifixion and resurrection of
Jesus Christ says that:

“Those who were assembled asked him, saying:

Lord, will you restore the kingdom to Israel at this time?

He answered them:

—It is not for you to know neither the times nor the occasions that the
Father arranged by his own authority. But they will receive power when the
Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in
Jerusalem, in all Judea, in Samaria and to the ends of the earth.

After saying this, and while they saw him, he was lifted up; and one
cloud received him hiding him from their eyes. and how they
were looking up at the sky as he was leaving, here are two
men dressed in white appeared next to them,
and they said:

"Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up at the sky?" East
Jesus, who was taken from you up to heaven, will come from the same
the way they have seen him go to heaven” [^493].

And in 2 Peter 3, Peter warns us that:

“Know that in the last days scoffers will come with their
ridicule, who will proceed according to their low passions and say: "Where
is the promise of his coming? Because since the day our fathers
slept all things remain the same, just as from the beginning of
the creation". Well, of their own free will they overlook this: that
by the word of God the heavens existed from ancient times, and the
land that arose from the water and was settled in the midst of the water. For this the
The world of that time was destroyed, flooded with water“ [^494].

And when the disciples ask Jesus Christ, what sign will there be of your
coming? According to Matthew 24 and 25, the answer has several parts. And by
the answers that Jesus Christ gives the thing seems quite dramatic and
unpleasant.

This is the good news that doesn't seem so good. The return of
Son of Man is good news for everyone who does NOT love the world.
The world, according to the bible, is the current system, the one that is under the
dominion of Satan, as far as God allows it. for the world and for
everyone who loves the world, the return of the Son of Man are bad
news.

The return of the Son of Man is related in the books of the
prophets, in the gospels, some passages, from Paul's letters, from
the letters of Peter, and the book of Revelation. the way to understand
the sequence of events describing the return of the Son of Man
there has to be a coherence between all of them.

The general context is a time when the Meshiakh of Israel will reign
over all nations and there will be peace in all the earth. This is the
main excuse that many Jews still have to say that
Jesus Christ cannot be the Meshiakh. Where is the King of the planet?
Where is that global peace, of all the nations and peoples of the
land, promised in the Hebrew scriptures?

#### Caveat.

Until now, your host, that is to say, Jose Luis Quiroga, can
say that you are fairly confident, say more than 95 percent, of
that EVERYTHING presented up to now is true, it is biblical, it is
what the scriptures teach. The rest is reserved, let's say that 5 per
cent, to be completely wrong. But his doubts are very
little.

As far as this part of the future is concerned, the sequence of
events having to do with the return of the son of man, his
host, myself Jose Luis Quiroga, must admit that his confidence is reduced
to 70 percent. And in some respects, the minority, say 4 of the
22 chapters of the book of Revelation, there are great doubts as to how
understand them coherently with the rest of the prophetic books and with
the whole bible. In these 4 chapters: 12, 13, 17 and 18, trust is not
reaches 10 percent. The problem is always in the details. Y
there are details that are simply not clear.

Having made this warning, let's continue with the parts in which there is a 70
percent confidence.

#### Jesus Christ.

When the disciples ask Jesus Christ: What sign will there be of your
coming? In Matthew 24 [^495], he answers that: “Like the lightning that comes
from the east and shows itself to the west, so also will the coming
of the Son of man” [^496]. In Luke 17 he answers something similar:
“As the lightning that flashes illuminates the sky of a
end to end, so also shall the Son of Man be in his day” [^497].

It also says in Matthew 24 that: "As in the days before the
deluge were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,
until the day that Noah entered the ark, and they knew not until the
deluge and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of the
men. Then there will be two in the field; the one will be
taken, and the other shall be left: Two women grinding a
grinder; one will be taken, and the other will be left. Watch then, because
you do not know what hour your Lord will come” [^498]. And in Luke 17
adds: “It will also be as it was in the days of Lot:
They ate, drank, bought, sold, planted, and built; but the day
when Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and
destroyed everyone. So it will be on the day when the Son of God is revealed.
Man” [^499]. “On that night there will be two in one bed; the one will be
taken and the other will be left” [^500].

When Jesus Christ returns, it will be any moment, in an instant, and
people will lead a life in which they drink, buy, sell, plant,
they build and marry. Maybe that's why we see what he announced
Peter in 2nd Peter 3 what would happen, that some mockers say: "Where
is the promise of his coming? Because since the day our fathers
slept all things remain the same, just as from the beginning of
creation” [^501].

#### Peace.

In Isaiah 2 it says that: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that
the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be confirmed as the chief of the mountains,
and he shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall stream to him. Y
Many peoples will come and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to
the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us in his ways, and we will walk
for their paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word out of Jerusalem.
of Jehovah. And he will judge between the nations, and will rebuke many peoples; Y
They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: they will not lift up
sword people against people, nor will they rehearse for war anymore” [^502].

In Isaiah 9 it says that: "For a child is born to us, son
it is given to us; and the principality upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called
Admirable, Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of PEACE. It
dilated of his empire and peace will have no end, on the throne of
David, and over his kingdom, arranging and confirming it in judgment and in
justice from now to FOREVER. The zeal of Jehovah of armies
will do this” [^503].

In Jeremiah 33, Jehovah promises Israel that “I will cleanse you from all your
wickedness with which they sinned against me; and I will forgive all your sins with you
they have sinned against me, and with which they have rebelled against me. And it will be me for
name of joy, praise and glory, among all the peoples of the
earth, that they will have heard all the good that I do them; and they will fear and
they will tremble from all the good and from ALL the PEACE that I will make them” [^504].

In Zechariah 14 that: “And the Lord shall be king over all
land. In that day Jehovah will be one, and one will name her” [^ 505].

This was what the Israelites of the time of Jesus Christ were
waiting for the Meshiakh of Israel. That he was the king of all nations
and that there would be peace. That is the apology that some still insist on
Jews, some genetic descendants of Abraham, to deny Yeshua
as his Meshiakh.

In Zechariah 14 Jehovah also says that: BEFORE he reigns, "I
I will gather ALL nations to battle against Jerusalem; and the city will be
taken, and the houses shall be plundered, and the women forced: and half
of the city will go into captivity, but the rest of the people will not be cut down
of the city” [^506]. And when he is REIGNING, "ALL that are left
of the nations that came against Jerusalem shall rise from year to year to
TO WORSHIP the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the feast of the
Cabins” [^507].

And the country or nation that does not send emissaries every year to adore the King in the
Sukkot festival, the festival of Tabernacles, pailas and tuqui tuqui, nothing
of rains

When Jesus Christ, Yeshua, the Meshiakh of Israel returns there will be PEACE and the
will be the King of ALL the nations from Israel, the one who is already here,
that which is already a nation since 1948.

#### Temple.

In Ezekiel, 8 chapters are dedicated to describing what the temple will be like.
be built when the Meshiakh of Israel reigns over all
nations. One of the most interesting features of the temple
described in Ezekiel is that it has no walls or walls indicating
separation between types of people as if the temple had them before
Jesus Christ. Said temple, the one from the times of Jesus Christ, separated the
genetic descendants of Abraham from the rest of the people: the
pagans. The temple described in Ezekiel also does not have a veil that separates
to the Holy of Holies as a place to which only the
supreme priest. In this future temple EVERYONE will have access to the holy
of the saints.

This future temple is so important to the Bible that only the
Tabernacle of the Meeting, which was built as YHWH showed
Moses on Mount Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, that tent
that the Israelites carried for 40 years in the desert following a
pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night, only that
Tabernacle of the Meeting has more pages in the Bible dedicated to
describe and explain it than the future temple described in Ezekiel. That
future temple seems to be, according to the number of pages dedicated in the
Bible, more important than the previous ones.

Jeremiah 33 [^508] and Isaiah 66 [^509] speak of the time when
Jehovah will bring the Israelites back to their land and that the people
they shall bring praises and presents to the house of the Lord, to that temple which
Ezekiel describes in chapters 40 to 48 of his book.

In that future temple, according to Ezekiel 46, offering sacrifices will be made
daily. He says that: "You shall sacrifice to the Lord daily as a burnt offering
lamb a year old without blemish, every morning you will sacrifice it. And with him
every morning you shall make a present of the sixth part of an ephah, and the
third part of a hin of oil to mix with the flower flour:
present to Jehovah continually by a perpetual statute. They will therefore offer
the lamb, and the present and the oil, every morning as a burnt offering
continuous” [^510].

Another interesting feature of this temple, according to Ezekiel 47
[^511], is that water comes out of the sanctuary of the temple that when it comes out of the
temple is a small water source that has a low flow but at
As it moves away from the temple, the flow increases until it becomes a
river that reaches the dead sea. River that, because it is fresh water, makes
the dead sea ceases to be dead and people will be able to fish in that lake that
It is now called the "Dead Sea". Also, on the banks of the river
trees will grow that will always bear fruit in time that can be eaten and
the leaves of said trees will never fall and will be medicinal. Perhaps
because they are medicinal is that they will never fall. They will be so desired that the
people will rip them off before they fall. And whoever bathes or swims in that
river or in what is now the "dead sea" will heal and live.

That future temple is a temple such as has never been seen on this planet.

#### A thousand years.

In all the prophecies of the Bible the numbers are interpreted as
numbers. In Jose's dreams 11 stars are 11 brothers [^512], 3
shoots are 3 days [^513], 3 baskets are 3 days [^514], 7 cows
are 7 years, 7 spikes are 7 years [^515]. In the visions of Daniel 4
beasts are 4 empires [^516], 10 horns are 10 kings [^517], 70
weeks are 70 groups of 7 years [^518], 1290 days are 1290 years, 1335
days are 1335 years [^519]. It never happens that 11 means many, or
some, or few. 11 is 11, not 5, not 3, not 20.

The book of revelation is no exception: the 7 stars are 7
angels, the 7 lampstands are 7 churches [^520], the 7 seals are 7
processes or plagues [^521], the 7 trumpets are 7 processes [^522] and the 7
cups are 7 processes [^523]. Even in Revelation 17 the angel
explains to John that the 7 heads are 7 mountains and 7 kings [^524] and the 10
horns are 10 kings [^525].

In the same way, the correct interpretation of Revelation 20, as well
some do not want to accept it, is that when it says "a thousand years" it is
just that: “THOUSAND YEARS” [^526]. A thousand are a thousand, they are not 2 thousand, nor 4 thousand,
not 3 thousand, not a little bit, not for a long time.

These thousand years are a time of PEACE, in which according to Isaiah 65 a
person who dies at the age of 100 is considered a child and people will live
like the days of the trees [^527] and “the wolf and the lamb shall be
grazing together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and to the snake
dust will be their food” [^528], according to Revelation 20, it will be a thousand years of
PEACE because Satan, also called "the ancient serpent" or "devil"
he will be chained in the abyss [^529]. Peace because the one who prevents it does not
can act by being chained.

According to Revelation 20, “when the thousand years are
fulfilled, Satan will be released from his prison” [^530] and will deceive the
nations and surround the city loved by God, but fire will fall from heaven
and will be defeated.

At the end of these thousand years, peace ends, there is a short war between
those who follow the Lamb, Jesus Christ, and those who follow Satan,
Gog and Magog, but soon everything is destroyed by the fire that falls from the
heaven.

Said physical fire that falls from the sky destroys those who were left
deceive by Satan. The rest of the people, those who were not
deceived by Satan, they will be transformed directly, without dying, to
his glorious body, that which is not affected by physical fire, as
Paul explains in 1st Corinthians 15 [^531].

At that time, the fire will also consume the entire planet, this sky
physical and this physical earth that we see today, as told to us by 2nd
Peter 3: “Then the heavens will pass away with great
noise; the elements, burning, will be undone; and the earth and the
works that are in it will be consumed. since all
these things must be undone, what kind of people must be
you in holy and pious conduct, waiting and hastening for the
coming of the day of God! For that day's sake the heavens, being
lit, they will be undone; and the elements, being scorched, will be
melted. According to God's promises we expect new heavens and earth
new in whom justice dwells” [^532]. It also announces
Isaiah 65 saying "For behold, I create new
heavens and new earth: and of the first there will be no memory, nor will more come
to thought” [^533]. And Revelation 21 saying: “And I saw
a new heaven, and a new earth: because the first heaven and the first
land they left, and the sea is no more” [^534]. And in Zephaniah 1 also
announces saying: "I will completely destroy all things on the face of
the earth, saith the Lord. I will destroy men and beasts; I will destroy
the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with
the wicked; and I will cut down men from off the face of the earth, he says
Jehovah” [^535].

This is the moment when Adam's offspring ends. Not anymore
but children of children of Adam. End, end, no more.

From this moment on, the new earth with the new heaven, that Kingdom
of Heaven, that Kingdom of God, which Jehovah began to build
spiritually since Jesus Christ began to announce the Kingdom of
Heavens, it begins to be a new earth and a new PHYSICAL sky too.
A Kingdom of Heaven also PHYSICAL here on this planet. a kingdom of
God in whom the Lord will dwell among men forever and
forever.

Paul explains in 1 Corinthians 15 quoting Hosea 13 saying
"Where is, oh die, your victory? where is he
death, your sting?” [^536]. And in Isaiah 25 this moment is announced
saying “He will destroy death forever; and the Lord will wipe away all
tear from all faces: and he will remove the reproach of his people from all
the earth: because Jehovah hath said it” [^537].

It is at the end of those thousand years that the physical resurrection of the
dead, that of ALL the dead, with the exception of 144,000 who already
they were resurrected. It is after those thousand years when they are resurrected
even the ones that have just been destroyed by the physical fire that
I destroy the previous physical heaven and earth. That's what it says
Revelation 20: “WHEN THE THOUSAND YEARS ARE FINISHED” [^538]. It's AFTER
those thousand years when the announcement of Jesus Christ that says:
“Do not be astonished at this, for the hour will come when
ALL who are in the graves will hear his voice and come out, who
did good for the resurrection of life but those who practiced
evil for the resurrection of” [^539] “judgment” [^540]. and what John
describes in Revelation 20 saying: “And the sea gave up the
dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead
that were in them; and they were judged, each one according to his works”
[^541].

#### 144,000

The firstfruits in Christ are first in the Spirit and then also
physically in the resurrection. All born again, all born in the
Spirit is spiritual firstfruits in Christ, but has not risen
physically yet.

When Matthew 27 speaks to us of the death of Jesus Christ, he also speaks to us
of some physical first fruits, he says: “they opened
tombs, and many bodies of saints who had fallen asleep,
they raised; And coming out of the tombs, after his resurrection,
they came to the holy city, and appeared to many” [^542].

Jesus Christ tells us about these FEW when speaking to the Israelites
tells them in Matthew 7 that: “For narrow is the gate, and
Narrow is the road that leads to life, and there are few who find it."
[^543], or in Matthew 20 when it says that: “because many
are called, but FEW are chosen” [^544].

In Revelation 14 we are told of these 144,000 that: “These are the ones who with
women were not contaminated; because they are virgins. These, the ones
They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were purchased from
among men for first fruits to God and to the Lamb. And in their
mouths has not been found guile; because they are without blemish before the
throne of God” [^545]. And in Revelation 7 he says that they are “of ALL
tribes of the children of Israel” [^546]. They are only Israelite males, twelve
a thousand from each tribe. Eye: Only from EACH tribe of the CHILDREN of ISRAEL
[^547]. And speaking in the past, and prophetically towards the future, we
he says that they will not have relations with women and will never lie.

From what Jesus Christ tells us in Luke 13 [^548], it follows that between
these will be Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the prophets. It is possible that
we can also count David among these FEW, if they are going to be fulfilled
literally the prophecies of the old testament. and for the evidence
archaeological site in Jerusalem, it can be believed that the tomb of David is
empty. So possibly David is also part of those who saw
walking through Jerusalem after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, according to
Matthew 27. Only that when he returns to our Lord, he will touch zero
sex. Virgin. Zero wives.

The apostles are also among the 144,000. According to Matthew 28: “Jesus
He said to them, Truly I tell you, you who have followed me in the
regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his
glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging
the twelve tribes of Israel” [^549]. And it is very possible that they are already
resurrected and with Jesus Christ in heaven. That one that has clouds and in
Adam's time had waters below and waters above.

Thus, many of these 144,000 are already resurrected and reigning with
Jesus Christ from Heaven, and right now what John
prophesied in Revelation 6, that: “they cried out with a loud voice
saying: How long, Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and come
our blood of those who dwell on the earth?” [^550]. But not yet
they have been sealed because they are not yet complete. And as some
forget what the scriptures say, you have to remind them that only the
alive, those who have a body and a mouth to speak, can cry out, can
think, they can praise. And to be in Heaven and be able to claim
he needs to be resurrected, in body and Spirit. The rest with your body
dusted and his spirit well asleep.

These 144,000 are the same ones mentioned in Revelation 20 when
John says that: “And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and
judgment was given to them; and I saw the souls of those slain for the testimony
of Jesus, and by the word of God, and that they had not worshiped the beast,
nor in his image, and who did not receive the mark on their foreheads, nor on their
hands, and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years” [^551].

The rest of those who START the thousand years, according to Revelation 7, are a
countless crowd. Multitude over which the 144,000 reign, multitude
which John describes in Revelation 7 as “These are they that come from the
great tribulation” [^552]. And that they are “a great multitude of all
nations and races and peoples and languages, and no one could count their number."
[^553].

But only those 144,000 are resurrected, the rest are not. the rest will die
physically ordinary. And this rest of those who START the thousand
years, that great crowd of Revelation 7, only includes those who "come
of the great tribulation” [^554]. That great multitude does not include any
person who has died physically. All the great crowd was alive
physically when that "great tribulation" began, from which, according to
Revelation 7, "come." Only after finishing that great
tribulation will live longer than those who died before that great
tribulation or during that great tribulation. As Isaiah says 65 a
person who dies at the age of 100 is considered a child and people will live
like the days of the trees [^555].

All 144,000 are sealed, appointed, chosen, BEFORE the
trumpets from the book of Revelation. ALL physically resurrected
they are part of the 144,000. But NOT ALL 144,000 have died
physically when the trumpets begin. That is to say that when
trumpets begin, NOT ALL of the 144,000 will have risen, the
most but not all. Some are killed and resurrected DURING the
trumpets.

This is why Revelation 20 describes some of the 144,000 as those
“Who had not worshiped the beast, nor his image, and had not received the
sign on their foreheads, nor on their hands” [^556]. everyone is finally
physically resurrected at the END of the sixth trumpet but BEFORE the
glasses. This is what Revelation 14 [^557] tells us about. In Revelation 7
they are marked, sealed and in Revelation 14 they are all resurrected.
These are the Saints mentioned in Revelation 13 when it says that at
first beast "was allowed to make war with the
saints and overcome them” [^558].

And let's remember that those 144.00 do not include women. There are no women
resurrected in the thousand years that Jesus Christ reigns along with those 144,000,
those FEW. The ones that exist are all among the great crowd that is dying
common and current. There are no virgin resurrected women and therefore
no woman, virgin or not, who has died, can PRAY for the
deadly. Every woman who has died physically has her body made
dust and his spirit well ASLEEP. Only until the thousand are FULFILLED
years will be resurrected with the rest of humanity.

Asking a woman who has physically died to PRAY for someone
before the heavenly Father or before his Son Jesus Christ is simply
summoning the dead There are no women resurrected until not
the resurrection of ALL the dead occurs, after the thousand years. Yes
someone asks a woman who has died to please “PRAY for
us now and at the hour of our death” is invoking a DEAD
and, according to the old testament, it is a sin punishable by death
physical.

Many believe that just by following Jesus Christ, or being born again
in the Spirit, or to die for Jesus Christ, are on that list of those who
They will reign with Jesus Christ for a thousand years. It will be because they like to reign. But
first you have to reign over Satan, sin and the world. First there is
than to lay Satan at our feet. And that only does the Spirit
Holy. And it is a process. First you have to go through the ETERNAL FIRE. A
those believers I recommend reading again the characteristics of the
who are on the list that will reign with Jesus Christ.

#### The God's anger.

There are only two ways to understand the processes of the book of Revelation
called “seals”, “trumpets” and “bowls”: spiritually or physically.
And by now it should be clear that your host, I Jose Luis
Quiroga, WAS the heavenly Father, the Holy Spirit and Life itself, the
that have led him to understand what the Bible says as it is and as
says the Bible, hard as it may be to believe. So this is not the
exception: the processes described in the “seals”, the “trumpets” and the
“cups”, as dramatic and catastrophic as they may seem, are as they are and
as described in the book.

When Revelation 8 says that: “the third part of the
trees was burned, and ALL the green grass was burned” [^559], which
means is exactly that: that a third of the
trees was burned and that ALL green grass was also burned.

When he says that: "the third part of the creatures died
that were in the sea” [^560], what it means is just that: that
a third of what lived in the sea died.

And when he says that the Sun and the Moon: "did not light the
third part of the day, and the same of the night” [^561], guess what? That
is what it MEANS.

The same thing happens when Revelation 9 says that for 5 months “they will seek
men death, and they will not find it; and will wish to die, and death
will flee from them” [^562], or when he says that: “the
third part of men” [^563], or when he says that those who remained
alive: “They did NOT repent of their murders, nor of their witchcraft, nor
of her fornication, nor of her thefts” [^564]. interpretation is
direct. There is nothing to interpret.

And that's just on the trumpets. Then come the drinks.

In Revelation 16 it says that the sea “became blood
as of a dead person; and EVERY living soul was KILLED in the sea” [^565].
It also says that rivers and water sources "are
turned into blood” [^566]. And that after this, 3 spirits
unclean acted on "the kings of the earth and of ALL
the world, to gather them for the battle of that great day of God
Almighty” [^567]. Another world war between 3 great powers.

But the thing does not end there, because later he says that there was
"an earthquake so great, such as has not been EVER since the
men have been on the earth” [^568] and that “the
cities of the world collapsed” [^569] and that “EVERY island fled, and the
mountains were not found” [^570]. An earthquake like it has NEVER been since
that men have been upon the earth, in which the cities of the
world COLLAPSES.

But it doesn't end there either. After that a “huge hail fell,
about thirty-four kilos in weight” [^571]. And here if the
interpretation may be somewhat different because the Greek word is
talantiaios that translates talent, and in John's time there were several
talent classes. It is possible that it refers to different values ​​between
32 kilos or 59 kilos. But let's say more than 32 kilos. hail like
bowling balls, which can also have different values ​​of
weight.

Revelation 16 also says that those who remain alive, after the
Hailstorm, which won't be many, because if a ball falls on one
of bowling the thing seems deadly, say a few thousand
people, what did they do? They BLASPHEMED against God [^572].
But, says Revelation 19, that those who are physically alive,
They were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the
who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were fed up with
their meats” [^573].

The book of Revelation teaches us that the final process before
beginning the thousand years of peace consists of 7 “seals”, where the 7th seal
corresponds to a process that is divided into 7 “trumpets”, and the 7th
trumpet corresponds to a process that is divided into 7 “cups”. The Bible
also teaches us that the 7 trumpets, that is, the first 6
trumpets and all the “cups” correspond to a process called the
"God's wrath. The wrath of God corresponds to the trumpets and bowls.

Of those who begin to receive the wrath, in the end, after the wrath,
after the “trumpets and the “bowls”, there are none left alive
physically. EVERYONE physically dies, one way or another. and I insist
in him physically, because before the anger started they were already dead
spiritually. Some, after starting the anger, are born
spiritually, but they are killed, physically dead, just
for being born in the spirit. They kill them before starting the "cups",
the final part of wrath, the seventh trumpet. Of those born again,
who are killed, says Revelation 14 that
"Blessed are the dead who henceforth
die in the Lord!” [^574]. And of those lucky ones who die during
the first 6 trumpets because of following Jesus Christ, but
Fortunate still are those who die with their throats cut, and are Jewish men,
because they are part of the 144,000 who were already chosen since
The Wrath of God began.

Perhaps because of this great suffering and death, just before
begin the seventh seal, that is, before all the trumpets and
all the bowls, says Revelation 6 that: “the kings of the earth, and the
princes, and the rich, and the captains, and the mighty, and every servant and
all free” “they said to the mountains and to the rocks: Fall
upon us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on
throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is
I come; and who can stand? [^575]. Lamb's Wrath The
trumpets and bowls are that wrath of God.

And for this host it is logically inconsistent, incoherent,
incongruous to believe that while these things are happening people
this “eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage” [^576], as
says our Lord Jesus Christ, according to Matthew 24, that it will be at the time
come back Or that people “ate, drank, bought, sold,
they planted and built” [^577], as Jesus Christ says, according to Luke 17.

When there is no drinking water, everything in the sea is dead, no
there is good light neither in the day nor in the night, and there is another world war,
people will not be thinking of getting married or planting or building or
in drinking People will be thinking about how to survive and according to what
The same book says "they did not repent of their murders, nor of their
witchcraft, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts” [^578]. oh and with
except for the few who die believing in Jesus Christ during the 6
first trumpets, ALL who are left alive after each plague,
physically because spiritually they are dead, they will also
blaspheme against God.

It is also very hard to believe that all the "trumpets" and "bowls"
take place "Like the lightning that comes from the east and appears to the
West” [^579], as Jesus Christ tells us that it will be his return according to
Matthew 24. Those “trumpets” and those “bowls” last a little while. something has already
past before the wrath of God.

#### Snatched.

Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 4 that those who are alive when he returns
Jesus Christ will be “caught up in the clouds to RECEIVE the
Lord in the air” [^580]. TO RECEIVE, that is, to return later with
Jesus Christ once the reception is over.

Paul also says in Romans 5 of believers in Jesus Christ that
"Justified by his blood, by him we shall be saved from
WRATH” [^581]. And in 1 Thessalonians 5 it says, "Because we
God has appointed for WRATH, but to attain health by our Lord
Jesus Christ” [^582]. And in 1 Thessalonians 1 he talks about “waiting for his
Son of heaven, whom he raised from the dead; to Jesus, who
delivered us from the WRATH that is to come” [^583]. Of the IRA that is to come.
When? Well, just when he comes back, that's why he talks about waiting for his
Son. That is why in Romans 2 it tells us about the "day of WRATH and
manifestation of the just judgment of God” [^584]. day that doesn't last long
“Because his WRATH lasts only a moment but his favor lasts a LIFETIME. For
crying lasts at night but joy will come at dawn” [^585], that
says Psalm 30. A little over 3 and a half years of IRA. say about 4 to
6 years of IRA. While his favor lasts for a lifetime, and
let us remember that life in Christ Jesus is ETERNAL.

Thus, while those who have been raptured are receiving Jesus Christ
the rest are under the wrath of God. Receiving trumpets and bowls.

Those chosen by Jesus Christ are raptured or taken as it says in Matthew
24: “there will be two in the field; the one will be taken, and the other will be
left: Two women grinding at a grinder; one will be
taken, and the other will be left. Watch therefore, because you do not know what hour
your Lord shall come” [^586]. Or in Luke 17 when he says, "In
that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be
left” [^587]. And this will happen "Like the lightning that comes from the east
and appears to the west, so also will be the coming of the Son of
man” [^588].

This will be the day of his return. A day that lasts a thousand years because Peter
explains that: “one day before the Lord is like a thousand years and
a thousand years as a day” [^589]. And those who live that day will always be
before the Lord, because Jesus Christ will be reigning, from the temple
described in Ezekiel, which will be built in Israel, with the help of
144,000 singled out, over a multitude that cannot be counted, those who
were caught up, those who come from the great tribulation, escaping from
The God's anger. A thousand years that come AFTER the trumpets and the
glasses.

The taken or carried away, together with the 144,000, will be the first to
physically they will begin to fulfill the biblical promises that the righteous
They will inherit the earth.

The taken or raptured are that great multitude described by Revelation
7 as “These are the ones who come from the great tribulation” [^590]. And that
They are “a great multitude from all nations and races and peoples and
tongues, and no one could count their number” [^591]. description it does
Revelation 7 just before the seventh seal. He says of this crowd that:
They were before the throne and in the presence of the Lamb,
dressed in white clothes, and palms in their hands; And they cried out loud
voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits on the throne,
and to the Lamb” [^592].

In this context it is very easy to understand the words of Jesus Christ in his
parables of Matthew 25 when it says that the kingdom of heaven will be like
10 virgins in which 5 wise enter the wedding and others do not [^593],
or the parable in which he says that “when the Son of the
man come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then
He will sit on the throne of his glory. And they will be gathered before him
all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as he separates the
shepherd the sheep of the goats” and to some he will say “come, you blessed of
my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world” and to the others he will say “depart from me, you cursed, into the fire
eternal prepared for the devil and for his angels” [^594]. And so
the first part of the physical manifestation of the Kingdom of the
Heaven on earth, and the words of Jesus Christ when he says that:
"Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the
kingdom of heaven: but whoever does the will of my Father who is
in heaven. Many will say to me on that day: Lord, Lord, right?
we prophesy in your name, and in your name we cast out demons, and in your
name we did a lot of miracles? And then I will protest to them: I will never
I met; depart from me, you evildoers” [^595].

Those who enter the wedding are those taken or raptured to RECEIVE
Jesus Christ and then RETURN to him. The rest stay out of weddings.
And in Matthew 22 they give us an additional detail when in another parable of
wedding tells us that: "And the king went in to see the
guests, and there he saw a man not dressed for a wedding. And he said to him: Friend,
how did you get in here not having a wedding dress? But he closed the
mouth. Then the king said to those who served: Bound hand and foot
take him, and throw him into the outer darkness: there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth” [^596]. Even after having entered the weddings
They can return it if it is not in a wedding dress. If you haven't washed your clothes
and has made them white with the blood of the Lamb, according to Revelation 7.
They are a minority because of all those who were at the wedding, of that great
crowd, they only returned 1, but they can return it.

These weddings are the same ones that Revelation 19 tells us about when
He says: “Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory; because they have arrived
marriage of the Lamb, and his wife has prepared. And she has been
granted that he be clothed in fine linen, clean and bright; because the
fine linen is the righteous actions of the saints. And the angel told me:
Write: Blessed are those who are called to the wedding supper of the
Mutton. And he said to me: These are true words of God ”[^ 597].

#### Great Tribulation.

Jesus Christ warns his followers that: “In the world
you will have affliction: but take heart, I have overcome the world” [^598]. And that
“You will be hated by all because of my name; but the one that
endure to the end, he shall be saved” [^599]. And that
“They will put you out of the synagogues; and the time is coming, when
whoever kills you will think that he is serving God” [^600]. Y
that “you will be delivered even from your fathers, and brothers, and relatives,
and friends; and they will kill some of you” [^601]. And that:
"Brother will deliver brother to death, and father
to the son: and the sons shall rise up against their fathers, and kill them."
[^602]. And that: “If the world hates you, know that to me
he hated me before he hated you” [^603]. And that: “It is not
the servant greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, also
ye shall persecute” [^604]. And that “they will hand you over to
be afflicted, and they will kill you; and you will be hated by all nations
for my name's sake” [^605].

And in particular for the moment when he is going to return, in Matthew 24
tells us that: “then there will be great affliction, such as
It was from the beginning of the world until now, nor will it ever be” [^606]. The same
tells us in Mark 13: “Those days will be trouble,
which never was from the beginning of creation that God created, until
this time, nor will it be” [^607]. Which was NOT from creation and will NOT be
later.

And he adds that “if those days were not shortened, he would not be saved.
no one; but for the sake of the elect, those days
they will be shortened” [^608]. They are shortened by and for the elect, because
for the rest no. The rest all suffer the wrath of God and die
physically because we remember that spiritually they were ALREADY dead.
They will only live again physically until the moment of the resurrection of
the dead, a thousand years later.

The chosen start the great tribulation but do not suffer the most
dramatic, the one in which no one survives, the so-called wrath of God. The
chosen only live the tribulation, that is, the beginning of the great
tribulation.

The tribulation only includes the first 6 “seals”, and these are suffered by
all the planet. The great tribulation also includes the 7th seal. 7th
seal that, let us remember, corresponds to the trumpets and bowls, the wrath
of God.

In Revelation 6, John tells us that a horseman who is given
“power to take peace from the earth, and to kill some
to others” [^609]. And from another horseman to whom she was given
"power over a fourth of the earth, to kill
with sword, with famine, with slaughter, and with the beasts of the earth”
[^610].

Which corresponds to the description made by Jesus Christ according to
Matthew 24 on the events prior to his arrival: “he
nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be
pestilences, and famines, and earthquakes throughout the places” [^611] and that He
calls the “beginning of sorrows” [^612]. which also
it is narrated in Mark 13 [^613].

Like someone who says nothing that hasn't been seen since Jesus Christ was resurrected,
just more often. Just like with labor pains,
these pains are getting more followed as the
moment of his coming.

According to Revelation 6, when the Lamb opened the sixth seal there was "a great
earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of sackcloth, and the moon
put all as blood; And the stars from heaven fell on the
earth, as the fig tree casts its figs when it is shaken
wind. And the sky departed like a book that is rolled up; and all mountains
and the islands were moved from their places” [^614].

Which corresponds to what was described by Jesus Christ in Matthew 24 after
that “beginning of sorrows”: “the sun will be darkened, and the
The moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the virtues
of heaven shall be shaken” [^615]. Or with what is described in Mark 13:
“The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its
radiance; And the stars will fall from the sky, and the
virtues that are in heaven will be shaken” [^616].

It does not seem very easy to fulfill that: "the stars of the sky fell
on the earth, as the fig tree casts its figs when it is shaken
wind” [^617], but a clearer and more graphic description could not be asked for.
This description corresponds with the one given by Isaiah 34 for the
moment of the beginning of the wrath of God: “And all the host of the
heavens shall be corrupted, and the heavens shall fold like a book: and shall fall
all his army, as the leaf of the vine falls, and as the one of
the fig tree” [^618]. The Hebrew word that is sometimes translated as
stars is the word tzabaot, the H6635. This word, which is the one
appears in Isaiah 34, literally translates "hosts" for being in
plural. This Hebrew word when referring to the heavens can
refer to the stars or to everything in the heavens including
the birds, but the correct thing in this context is to understand it as the
armies of angels that are in heaven. What falls as the leaf falls
of the vine or the figs of the fig tree are angels. armies of them.
Just as and as Jesus Christ continues describing that moment in Matthew
24: “they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds
from heaven, with great power and glory. And he will send the angels from him with a loud voice
with a trumpet, and they shall gather his elect from the four winds, from one end
from heaven to the other” [^619].

This is the moment that happens like lightning, the moment when some
are snatched or taken and others are not. The moment that no one knows
day or hour, only the heavenly Father. Eye neither the day nor the hour. East
moment comes as in the time of Noah or as in the time of Lot: in a
INSTANT. And although neither the day nor the hour is known, the year has to
be very close

The good news for those who ARE raptured, according to Jesus Christ in
Luke 17, is that, despite the moments of great tribulation, more
of which there has never been and never will be, they have already begun, by the time
believers be caught up, people still “ate, drank,
they bought, they sold, they planted and they built” [^620]. That is, until the
believers are raptured life goes on more or less as it has been since
that Jesus Christ was resurrected. Good news for the raptured.

The bad news for those who are NOT raptured is that by the time
end the great tribulation everyone dies. Not a single one left alive. And how
those are precisely those who did NOT believe in the resurrection of
Jesus Christ, but death is the end, because for them they are very
bad news. It's bad news because they think it's the end. It
It is true that they have to wait until the resurrection of the dead to
realize that what they believed was false, which in reality are
good news if they could believe it. Bad news for those who know
remain.

#### The Abomination of Desolation.

According to Matthew 24, Jesus Christ explains that the beginning of the Great
Tribulation is marked by the time "when ye shall see
the abomination of desolation, which was spoken by Daniel the prophet,
will be in the holy place, (he who reads, understand)” [^621]. and very words
similar according to Mark 13 “when you see the abomination of desolation,
that was said by the prophet Daniel, that he will be where he should not (he who
read, understand)” [^622].

There are only two verses in the new testament that mention the prophet
Daniel. They are these two and both are in the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ
announcing the beginning of a "great affliction, such as was not from the
beginning of the world until now, nor will it be” [^623].

The Greek word behind the word “to see”, the word G3708, horaó,
it is also used in the sense of understanding, discerning, recognizing.
That is why at the end of both texts he also emphasizes "the one who reads
in shop".

To see, understand, discern and recognize, let us first see, understand and
Let's recognize what Daniel spoke of.

The phrase "Abomination of Desolation" refers to the sequence of
Hebrew words “shiqquts” and “shamem”, the words H8251 [^624] and
H8074 [^625]. This sequence only appears in 3 verses in the entire
tanakh: in Daniel 9 [^626], in Daniel 11 [^627] and in Daniel 12 [^628].

##### The final moment.

The first to understand of the 3 mentions in the Tanakh of the sequence
“Abomination of Desolation” is the one in Daniel 12. This allows us to see,
understand, discern and recognize what time it is. happens in
Daniel 12 when the angel says to Daniel: “Come on, Daniel, what are you doing?
words are closed and sealed until the time of
compliance. Many will be clean, and made white, and purified; plus
The wicked will act wickedly, and none of the wicked will understand, but
the connoisseurs will understand. And from the time that the
continuous sacrifice until the dreadful abomination, there will be twelve hundred
and ninety days. Blessed is he who will wait, and will reach a thousand
three hundred thirty-five days” [^629].

So let's begin to open and unseal these words because
It is the time of fulfillment.

It is completely undeniable that if the principle of
prophetic interpretation called "a year for every day", the prophecies in
Daniel 9 corresponds perfectly with Jesus Christ as the Meshiakh of
Israel and the temple of Jehovah in Jerusalem. predicting the moment of
beginning of the reconstruction of the temple, the moment of the beginning of the
ministry of Jesus Christ, the time of the death of Jesus Christ, and the
time of the destruction of the temple by the Romans. so it's not
preposterous to think that it is at least possible to apply the principle with
other prophecies in Daniel. Which is precisely what makes it possible to discern
Daniel 12 in regards to the "Abomination of Desolation".

The first thing to determine is the date on which the slaughter was suspended
newspaper. There are several possibilities for this date but the argument
fundamental to this explanation is that the way we see written the
word “south”, the H5493, which is translated as “REMOVED” in the text
”from the time the continual sacrifice was TAKEN AWAY” [^630], only
appears in two verses of the tanakh: in Daniel 12 and in Leviticus 4
when he says "he will remove all his fat, in the way that
the fat of the sacrifice of peace was taken away” [^631] and the occurrence
it is when referring to fat that was REMOVED in the peace offering.

Understanding in this way the "removed" when Daniel 12 tells us that:
”from the time the continual sacrifice was TAKEN AWAY” [^632], only
There are two reasonable possibilities, from Daniel's point of view, in
that the continual sacrifice was taken away:

1. The moment narrated in 2nd Kings 24 when Nebuchadnezzar went up against
    Jerusalem in the time of King Joachim aged 18 and
    “he brought out from there all the treasures of the house of the Lord,
    and the treasures of the royal house, and broke into pieces all the vessels of
    gold that Solomon king of Israel had made in the house of the Lord.
    [^633], or
2. The moment narrated in 2nd Kings 25 when Nebuchadnezzar takes
    Jerusalem and “burnt the house of the Lord, and the house of the
    king, and all the houses of Jerusalem; and all the houses of the
    princes burned with fire” [^634].

According to historical evidence, the first moment happened in 598 or 597
before Jesus Christ and the second moment happened in 587 or 586 before
of Jesus Christ.

If each day is a year in Daniel 12, the "Abomination of Desolation"
corresponds to what happened 1290 years later in the place of the Saint of
the Saints.

Regarding the first option, the completion of the golden dome of the
Roca, between 691 and 692 after Jesus Christ.

And regarding the second option, the completion of the Al-Aqsa Mosque
between 702 and 703 after Jesus Christ.

Both located on top of Jehovah's Holy Mountain, Mount Moriah,
above where Solomon's temple was built.

As an observation for people who like to add: you have to take into account
Note that there is no year zero. From 1 before Jesus Christ it went to 1
after Jesus Christ.

The "Abomination of Desolation" is the temple complex of Muhammad
above the holy place. They are the objects that represent the most false
prophet in the entire history of mankind, Muhammad, above the place
holy, of the holy mount, of mount Moriah, of the one true God,
of the creator of heaven and earth.

And if you had not seen it that way, you have already begun to see it and
the words of Jesus Christ began to be fulfilled: “when they see” and “the
let him read understand”.

Thus, by the time the majority of the body of Jesus Christ, of the congregation
of the born again, see, understand, discern and recognize the
"Abomination of Desolation", by the time that happens, the Great
Tribulation, that period of time of suffering like never before and
there will never be, it will have already begun.

And according to Daniel 12 [^635], blessed are those who manage to wait for the
1335 years since that mosque is in the holy place. for the first
option that year is between 2026 and 2027 and for the second option it is
between 2037 and 2038.

This host, Jose Luis Quiroga, believes any of the great
pending events regarding the return of Jesus Christ will happen in that
moment of "blessed". Even the one that simply fulfills the
words of Jesus Christ: “When YE SEE the abomination
of desolation, which was spoken by Daniel the prophet, who will be in the
holy place, (he who reads, understand)” [^636], indicating the beginning of the
Great Tribulation.

##### 70 Weeks.

The second to understand of the 3 mentions in the Tanakh of the sequence
"Abomination of Desolation" is that of Daniel 9. This occurrence of the
sequence of Hebrew words “shiqquts” and “shamem”, the words H8251
[^637] and H8074 [^638], commonly translated as “Abomination of
Desolation” is just after the end of the 70 weeks prophecy
in Daniel. The 70-week prophecy ends in the middle of the
verse 27 [^639].

It is a very common construction in Hebrew to put a “vev” character before
to the word “al”, the word H5921, to indicate “and after”, or “and
on”, or “and above”, as a grammatical continuation. and this
continuation can happen even 600 years later.

Thus, the description of the 70 weeks ends with the word "minkha",
the word H4503, which means gift or offering, and refers to the
death of Jesus Christ in the middle of the last week.

This last week ends with the appearance of Jesus Christ to Shaul,
commonly known as Paul, on his way to Damascus [^640], just 7
years after Jesus Christ was baptized by John the Baptist and
will mark the beginning of this last week. It is with this last act that
Jesus Christ brings enduring righteousness and seals vision and prophecy,
thus fully completing 70 weeks. Sealing the 70 weeks.

There are no weeks floating around in a vacuum as some believe. Not that way
Bible prophecy works. Either it is fulfilled or it is not fulfilled. This is
fulfilled perfectly. The Hebrew is a bit obscure, but it doesn't
You need to speak perfect Hebrew to interpret it correctly. only does
need to use the internet.

Understanding that the 70 weeks are complete, Daniel 9 is consistent
with Daniel 12 in identifying the "Abomination of Desolation" with the
Muhammad's temple complex above the Holy Place in Jerusalem.

##### North and south.

And the third to understand of the 3 mentions in the Tanakh of the sequence
"Abomination of Desolation" is that of Daniel 11.

Daniel 11 anticipates how control over
Jerusalem and the territory of Solomon's Israel alternate between forces
northern and southern forces represented in history by different
Names.

In the narration of Daniel 11 [^641] it can be observed how the power
over the territory over and around Jerusalem since the alliance
Medo-Persian takes control, has been alternating between forces of the
North and South forces [^642]. Figures can be identified as
Alexander the Great, some Antiochus, some Ptolemies, some Caesar and
some periods such as the Byzantine, the first Muslim, the Crusades and
the second Muslim.

The key, as always, to be able to understand a passage of the
scriptures, is Our Lord Jesus Christ. It should first be noted that the
word H1285 [^643], translated as “covenant”, is only used by Daniel
on 6 occasions and always to represent the holy pact between God and his
village. This allows us to identify that in the narrative Jesus Christ is
represented by the phrase "the Prince of the Covenant" or "Head of the Covenant." Y
this in turn allows establishing a central time point to the
narration and thus be able to map the history of the territory of the current
Israel with the narration.

Understanding that the "Prince of the Covenant" moment in Daniel 11 is
corresponds to the time of Jesus Christ, then the moment in which
mentions the "Abomination of Desolation" in Daniel 11 corresponds to
control of the early Muslim period over Jerusalem, and with the time
when the Muslim temple complex was built on Mount
Holy in Jerusalem.

The three mentions in the Tanakh of the "Abomination of Desolation" are
consistent in identifying it with Muhammad's temple complex above
of the Holy Place in Jerusalem.

#### Israel.

The main fulfilled prophecy that tells us that the year of the return of
Yeshua, of Jesus Christ, of Our Lord, of the King of Kings, of the Meshiakh
of Israel, it is very close, even if we do not know the day or the hour, it is the
existence of Israel for less than 100 years.

In Deuteronomy 30 the end is announced from the beginning, it says that:
after Jehovah “uprooted them from their land with
wrath, and with fury, and with great fury, and drove them into another land” [^644]
; and after: “All nations shall say, Why
what did Jehovah do this to this land? what anger is this so great
fury? And they will respond. Because they left the pact of
Jehovah the God of their fathers, which he arranged with them when he brought them out
out of the land of Egypt, and they went and served other gods, and
bowed down to them, gods they did not know, and that nothing
had given” [^645]; after “all have come
these things, the blessing and the curse that I have set before you."
[^646]; THEN Jehovah “will return your captives, and he will have
mercy on you, and will gather you again from all the peoples
which the LORD your God scattered you. if you had
been cast out to the ends of the heavens, from there the Lord your
God, and from there he will take you: And return you to the Lord your God to the land that
your fathers inherited, and you SHALL POSSESS it; and she will do you good, and she will multiply you
more than your parents” [^647].

Since the time of Moses, more than 1400 before Jesus Christ, it was
announced everything that would happen to the people of Jacob, to the people of
Israel, the chosen people of Jehovah.

First they would be blessed with the promised land, with the land in which
King David and King Solomon reigned between 1000 before
Jesus Christ and 930 BC, and then they would be cursed by
break the pact and worship other Gods and Nebuchadnezzar would be in charge
to execute one of the most important moments of such curses to the
invade the only thing left to invade, Jerusalem, in the year 587 or 586
before Jesus Christ, at which time the temple built by Solomon
almost 400 years before it was completely destroyed and moment from the
which the descendants of Jacob, the Israelites, could never again
buy and sell land, to be owners of that land, until the year
1948, more than 2500 years later, when God begins to fulfill his promise
to bring them back to their land.

The creation of the current country Israel was announced almost 3500 years ago
by the creator God of heaven and earth, who tells us:
“Remember the past things from the age; because I
I am God, and there is no other God, and there is nothing like me; what an announcement
to come from the beginning, and from ancient what was not yet done;
I say: My advice will stand, and I will do whatever I want; what do i call
from the east to the bird, and from a distant land to the man of my council. I
I spoke, and I will make him come: I have thought it, and I will also do it. listen to me, hard
of heart, that you are far from justice. I'll make you come closer
justice, shall not depart: and my health shall not stand still. And I will put health in
Zion, and my glory in Israel” [^648].

Jehovah also speaks to us through Jeremiah. In Jeremiah 29 to 33 we
gives various details of what is only happening so far.

In the first instance it mentions that "When in Babylon
are seventy years old, I will visit you, and wake up over you
my good word, to return you to this place” [^649]. those seventy years
They range from when Daniel is taken into exile in Babylon in 607 before
of Jesus Christ until some of the exiles return to Jerusalem
in Babylon in 537 BC with the permission of Cyrus.

But he also tells us about another time when "I will return
your captivity, and I will gather you from all nations, and from all
places where I have driven you, saith the Lord; and I will bring you back to the place of
where I caused you to be taken” [^650], and that “behold,
The days are coming, saith the Lord, when I will return the captivity of my people
Israel and Judah, saith the Lord, and I will bring them back to the land which I gave to
her fathers, and SHALL POSSESS her” [^651], and that “in that day,
saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from your neck, and
I will break your bonds, and strangers WILL NOT put it back in
servitude” [^652], and that “Jacob will return and be
calm; he will be confident, and there will be no one to frighten him” [^653], and that
“Your children will be as in the past, and your congregation will have stability
in front of me. And I will punish all the oppressors of him” [^ 654], and that “in
At that time, says the LORD, I will be the God of all the families of
Israel; and they shall be my people” [^655], and that “Even
I will build, and you will be built, O virgin of Israel: you will still be
adorned with your tambourines, and you will go out in a circle of dancers. Yet
you shall plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and
they will make common use of them” [^656], and that they “shout for joy before the HEAD
of the nations” [^657], and that “behold, I bring them out of the land of
north, and I will gather them from the END of the earth. among them will come
the blind and the lame, the pregnant woman and the one who gives birth. Like a
great multitude shall return hither” [^658], and that “Hear the word of the Lord, O
people, and make it known in the islands that are far away, and say: He who
scattered Israel, he will gather them and keep them, as a shepherd guards his cattle."
[^659], and that Jerusalem will “NEVER AGAIN BE PULLED UP NOR DESTROYED” [^660].

Jeremiah was a prophet who announced, according to Jeremiah 21, that Jehovah
deliver what was left of Judah and Jerusalem to Nebuchadnezzar, king of
Babylon, and that this one would not spare them or have compassion or
mercy. That Jerusalem would be burned and given up and that he who
happened to the Chaldeans, to those who had them besieged, he would live. And that
Zedekiah, the king of Judah, would be taken prisoner to Babylon. And in
Jeremiah 26 tells us that Jeremiah is threatened with death by
prophesy against Jerusalem. He also prophesies, according to Jeremiah 29,
that the captivity in Babylon will be long and that they build and cultivate and
eat the fruit of the crop, marry and have children, and seek
peace and pray for the peace of the Babylonians because the peace of Babylon
it is the peace of captives.

All these prophecies that no one wanted to hear, make me end up imprisoned in
the courtyard of the prison of the house of Zedekiah, the king of Judah. and being
prisoner, according to Jeremiah 32, Jehovah commands him to buy a piece of land from a
his cousin named Hanameel as a sign that one day the
Israelites, "Houses, and fields, and vineyards shall be bought in this land"
[^661] again.

Jeremiah buys the land from his cousin, being imprisoned in the house of the
king and knowing that Nebuchadnezzar is about to invade Jerusalem, as
sign that one day the Israelites "will buy houses, and lands,
and vineyards in this land” [^662] again.

This prophecy is only fulfilled until the 20th century after Jesus Christ,
less than 100 years ago, when the country of Israel was founded in 1948, and the
descendants of Abraham can return to BUY AND SELL in what
now it is Israel.

Jehovah also announces, according to Jeremiah 32, that “behold, I will
I will gather from all the lands to which I have driven them in my fury, and with
my anger and great fury; and I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them
dwell safely” [^663], and that they “will possess an inheritance in this land of
which you say: It is deserted, without men and without animals”
[^664].

Jehovah announces in Jeremiah 16 that “behold, days are coming when no one will say
more: 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land
out of Egypt!' but, 'As the LORD lives, who brought up the children of Israel
from the land of the north and from all the lands where there were
exiled!'. For I will bring them back to their land, which I gave to their fathers."
[^665].

This prophecy, according to which YHWH will be known as the one who gathered
the Jews of all the nations into which he had scattered them in the
which is now Israel, just as it had announced thousands of years before,
is already starting to come true.

Isaiah also prophesies in Isaiah 11 that God will “gather
the exiles of Israel. He will gather the scattered Judah from the
four corners of the earth” [^666].

In Ezekiel 11, Jehovah announces that “I will gather you from the
peoples, and I will gather you from the lands in which you are scattered, and
I will give you the land of Israel” [^667]. And in Ezekiel 37, Jehovah says that
“I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of
Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and there shall be no more two
nations, nor shall they ever again be divided into two kingdoms” [^668].

In Ezekiel 36, God tells Ezekiel to "say to the house
of Israel: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I do not do it for you, O
house of Israel, BUT FOR MY HOLY NAME, which you have profaned
you among the nations where you have arrived” [^669],
“I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all
lands, and I will bring you to your country” [^670], “I am not doing it for you,
saith the Lord Jehovah, be ye known: be ashamed, and confuse yourselves
your iniquities, house of Israel” [^671]. And that "the
a desolate land shall be tilled, instead of having been desolate in the eyes of
all those who passed; Who said, This desolate land was like
Garden of Eden; and these deserted and desolate and ruined cities,
strengthened they were. And the people who were left in your
surroundings, they will know that I built the demolished ones, and planted the
desolate: I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it” [^672].

The existence of present-day Israel is a unique case in the entire history of
The humanity. The smallest town on the entire planet was dispersed
all over the planet and after thousands of years of being dispersed
all over the planet, now, reunited, owns the same territory
that it had at the beginning of its existence, just as it was written that
would happen, hundreds of years before being dispersed, and thousands, listen
well, THOUSANDS of years before it happened. And it preserves its culture, its
customs, its sacred book and its original language.

There is no other case like it in ALL the history of HUMANITY. If that is NOT
It's a HYPER-MEGA-SUPER PROPHECY, I don't know my mom's name.

But it is not all.

In Amos 9, God announces that “I will return the captivity of my
people Israel, and they shall build the desolate cities, and the
they will dwell; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink their wine; and they will
gardens, and eat their fruit. For I will plant them on their land,
and NEVER again shall they be uprooted from their land that I gave them, saith the Lord
Your God” [^673].

Israel is here to stay. Promise of the creator God of Heaven and
Land.

#### Details.

As for the chapters about which there are doubts, for that of
the details, it is worth mentioning the following issues:

##### Childbirth.

In Revelation 12 John says that: “a great sign appeared in heaven:
a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her
head a crown of twelve stars” [^674].

Without coming to worship the stars, which would be idolatry, and without
come to think that they influence our personality, which would be
occultism or witchcraft, some Christians accept that God gives us signs
using the stars to identify milestones of compliance
of prophecies. If we accept this, and bearing in mind that this
description is between the trumpets and the bowls in the narrative of the
book of Revelation, and that there are only two verses in the whole bible
in which the angel Michael is mentioned in prophecy, one in Daniel 12
[^675] and another in Revelation 12 [^676], and that in both occurrences the
narratives seem to refer to similar events, we have to locate the
Revelation 12 narrative in sync with Daniel 12.

If we do this, there is only one possible configuration of the sky in the
which this signal could have occurred in the sky: on September 23
of 2017. And as a significant fact is the fact that it corresponded
with the end of a very important annual biblical feast: the feast of
Trumpets.

The Revelation 12 configuration has 12 stars above the head of
the woman: the 9 stars of Leo and 3 more: Mercury, Mars and Venus. She has
to the moving star Jupiter, which traditionally represents the King,
emerging from the center of the woman, has the Sun "dressing" the
woman and has the moon at the woman's feet. Other candidates like
August 29, 439, or September 11, 3 BC, or
on August 16, 3 BC simply do not meet all the
features.

The woman would be Israel and would be the beginning of the spiritual birth of
Abraham's descendants as a nation, the time when the
inhabitants of Israel begin to be born into the kingdom of heaven by accepting
to his Meshiakh: Yeshua HaMashiakh, better known as Jesus Christ.

This spiritual birth of the Israelites, according to the statistics of
the first and only organization in the Israel of 2021 that has a
Bible school run by people born in Israel and believers
in Yeshua, the organization “One for Israel”, has already started. Growth
of born in Israel who are new believers in Yeshua seems to be
exponential, according to this organization.

If Miguel's timing is correct, another great
synchronicity in the book of Revelation:

1. The time of the first 6 trumpets,
2. The time of the two witnesses of Revelation 11 [^677],
3. The time of the woman in the desert of Revelation 12 [^678], and
4. The time of the first beast of Revelation 13 [^679],

correspond to exactly the same period of time and lasts 1260 days.

Trumpets that occur just after the spiritual birth of Israel, of the
time when Israel accepts its Meshiakh. Parturition that occurs at the end of
the first 6 seals of the book of Revelation and before the
rapture that occurs between the sixth and seventh seals.

##### 7 messengers.

If in Revelation 12 the phrase “sign in the sky” refers to some
configuration in the firmament, also in Revelation 15 the phrase
it would have to be some stellar configuration when John tells us that:
"I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, which was
seven angels who had the seven last plagues; because in them it is
finished the wrath of God” [^680].

The only "great" configuration in the sky after 2017, and
quite strange in general, is the one that will occur on September 8,
2040, corresponding to the Feast of Trumpets of that year, when
the conjunction of the 7 mobile stars, or classic planets of the
antiquity, which can be seen without the aid of a telescope: Saturn,
Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, the Sun and the Moon.

In less than 20 degrees this very rare stellar alignment will be observed
idea. With less than 20 degrees of angular distance between the
objects. The previous one occurred on July 3, 710. Very rare
idea.

This heavenly configuration could be the announcement, the sign, that marks
the moment in which the 7 angels of Revelation 15 begin their activity of
pour out the final 7 bowls of God's wrath. This signal would mark the
beginning of bowls, that is, the beginning of the last trumpet of the
Book of Revelation.

##### Babylon.

The great prostitute of Revelation 17 and the great Babylon of Revelation 18
they would be one and the same. And it refers to all the people who are not
raptured and who die without having accepted Christ during the
trumpets or bowls. It would be all the people who stay in the
earth, in Babylon, and die physically, during the trumpets or the
cups, without having accepted Christ. The rapture would correspond to
moment when, according to Revelation 18, John says that: “I heard
another voice from heaven, saying: Come out of her, my people, because
be partakers of her sins, and receive not of her plagues."
[^681].

The end of the destruction of the Great Babylon corresponds with the
end of the seals, the trumpets and the bowls, all at the same time.
Because let us remember that the last seal is the 7 trumpets and the last
trumpet are the 7 bowls. Then begins the reign of Jesus Christ
from Israel for a thousand years.

#### Reign.

After the destruction of the great Babylon, the wrath of God,
the cups, the reign begins. Jesus Christ comes down from heaven with all the
countless multitude and clothed in white linen, of which Revelation speaks
7 [^682], and who went out to meet him according to Paul [^683]. All that
they were caught up to heaven. Crowd to be ruled by Jesus Christ
and 144,000 resurrected for a thousand years.

A thousand years of a reign of authentic peace because all the nations and
peoples will be made up of people who, prior to said
reigned, they had already accepted Jesus Christ as King. People who
they were willing to die for their cause and they died to everything they
were, or as Paul says "I have been crucified with Christ, and
I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me” [^684]. peoples and nations
made up of people in whom Christ already reigns in their hearts.

It is the SPIRITUAL beginning WITH the PHYSICAL presence of the king of kings, of the
Meshiakh of YHWH, of that new earth with a new sky that Isaiah announces
in its last two chapters. The SPIRITUAL beginning WITHOUT the presence
PHYSICS of Jesus Christ began from his resurrection. These beginnings are
only SPIRITUAL because the offspring of
Adam.

The PHYSICAL beginning of that NEW earth with a NEW heaven, according to
Revelation 21, happens AFTER the resurrection of ALL the dead. Y
this only happens until after the thousand years of the reign of Jesus Christ
from Israel, the one that is already here.

Jesus Christ does not come to reign over anyone who has not accepted him as
king prior to that time. He does not get to reign over Babylon.

This is GOOD news for those who already have Jesus Christ as King,
but they do not LOOK good to those who do not have him as King.

PART 3. PERIPHERY.
=====================================

beliefs.
-------------------------

At this point in the video it can already be said that the main objective of
give you some GOOD news and others that don't SEEM good, it's already been fulfilled.
However, not the entire set of questions that were posed to the
beginning of the video have been answers and that was a third objective:
kill all the birds with one stone.

The objective of this section is to present a whole series of topics that
are related to the Truth, to what the Bible affirms, and to the
word "science". And in this way kill the birds that follow
slopes.

Some of these topics, very few, can be related to the
technical creativity, that criterion that this video considers necessary
to discern what truly is a scientific theory. Is by
that this whole section is under the heading of simply beliefs.

In some cases what most people believe is not the same as
your host believes. For beliefs that your host considers false,
mostly popular, usually only the reasons are presented in
against, and for which their host considers true, mostly
unpopular, generally only the reasons in favor are presented. This does
Make presentations simpler and more dynamic.

All the beliefs presented have to do with the bible. If the
beliefs presented here as false are not false, or those presented
as true they are not true, the bible does not seem to be inspired by
the God who does not lie.

#### Principles.

Obviously the most important of all beliefs for a Christian is
that Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected. It is the beginning
foundation of the believer in Jesus Christ. As Paul says in 1st Corinthians
15: “If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, in vain.
it is also your faith” [^685].

Jesus Christ spoke of Noah, Jonah, Moses, and the Torah, which
includes the book of Genesis, as something completely true. Then if
Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected, we may not understand all the
details of why the whole bible has to be true but has to
be.

Thus, the two fundamental principles, which must be taken into account in
any support from here on, are the ones already analyzed
at the beginning of this video:

1. There is a Creator, designer and intelligent, of all plants, animals and
    person on this planet.
2. Jesus Christ is alive because, after dying on the cross, the Creator
    He raised him on the third day.

If these two fundamental points are denied, ignored, or not taken
taken into account in the next lifts, it is rationally much more
Difficult to accept these supports. On the other hand, if these
two principles are understood as true it is much easier to accept
these supports. So: if you don't understand them as true,
assume them hypothetically as true, as an exercise
intellectual, when analyzing the supports.

#### Evidence.

Another important point to note from this moment is that: in the
support of each belief the word “evidence” is used in the
context of the person who has studied the subject of belief.

This annotation is made because: what for a person can be
evidence, to another it may simply be a worthless statement
some. And this situation depends both on the level of skepticism of the
person, as well as the knowledge that the person has on the subject of the
presented belief.

If you have not studied the subject, the evidence presented may
seem worthless. You better study it and then take one
position.

It is because of this subjectivity that when an affirmation is presented as
evidence is made based on what other people, who have dedicated
longer than me, and most likely longer than you too, by
study of the particular subject, those people, ALSO consider it as
evidence.


HOME_SCRIPT
### The truth.

The Truth according to the Bible is something that is lived, that is experienced. According to
John 14, Jesus Christ says: "I am the way, the truth and the
life: no one comes to the Father except through me" [^686].
Jesus Christ is the Truth and to know the Truth is to know him. John, in
1st John 2 tells us that: “He who says he is in him must walk as he
walked” [^687]. He who says that he knows Jesus Christ must live like the
lived. This way of living is loving, John explains in 1st John 4 that "The
who does not love, does not know God; because God is love” [^688]. And he explains to us
Jesus Christ according to John 15 that "greater love has no one than this, that he put
someone his life for his friends” [^689]. Give yourself the whole person.
Jesus Christ has been giving us his complete person, his life, from the
creation of Heaven and Earth.

Thus, knowing The Truth is the object of Life itself. The truth is not
only information. He is a person, he is Jesus Christ himself.

#### The search.

The personal search for Truth begins when we have a brain
functioning in a body that can perceive its surroundings. It is the process of
form mental models that are consistent with the perceptions
said body receives.

It is not very different from the social process of searching for The Truth.

The human being has developed languages ​​to express models that are
consistent with the observations of their environment and thus be able to
predict outcomes and modify your environment by building
objects that fulfill the expected functionality.

These languages ​​can be named with the word "mathematics",
these models can be named with the word "theories", and to these
objects can be named with the word “technologies”. Also
more biblical words could be used and therefore closer to the
TRUE. Words such as “logical” could be used because of their origin in the
word logos, the word “names” and the word “creations”.

The problem lies in believing that knowing our environment, knowing the
Creation, is the same as knowing the Creator. Is not the same. meet the
creator is the reason for our existence, the cause and objective, the
beginning and end, the only thing that can satisfy the human being.

Knowing the creation is not enough to know the Creator. Jesus Christ
He warns us “I am the way, the truth and the life”. there is no other
path. He is the way. There is no other. That's why finally he is The
TRUE. That which we seek where it is not: in Creation.

The only mental model that can satisfy the knowledge of the
Reality, of The Truth, is the mind of Jesus Christ. The only name that
appropriates the fundamental reason of the human being is Jesus Christ himself.
When Jesus Christ lives in me and I die to myself, I reach The Truth.
That which I seek so much, that which I desire so much.

We are in search of The Truth.

### Supernatural.

Your host's position on the word "miracle" and the word
“supernatural” is based on biblical concepts.

This means that miracle does not mean anything different from "sign" or
"Wonderful". This means that no matter how AMAZED someone is
with a miracle, this does not mean that it does not have a RATIONAL explanation.
And that is precisely because it is difficult to explain rationally that
also consider a SIGN that it is the Creator who is
intervening in the WONDERFUL event.

This position is directly related to the word
“supernatural”, which does not really exist in the Hebrew. has an origin
from Latin. The Latin word "natura" is so contrary to the Bible
which does not appear once in the old testament of the Vulgate. Only
it appears deformed 2 times as “naturae” and 1 time as “naturam” in the
Vulgate Old Testament. The reason is that the word itself
means "born" and implies, in its widespread use, that there is no
creator. Things are “born” ALONE somehow.

Thus, for its supernatural host it simply means above
what is “natural”, from what is simply “born”, that is to say, that HAS a
creator. If something has a creator it is “supernatural”. So anything
created by man is as "supernatural" as what is created by our
CREATOR.

That's why your host avoids the word "nature" like the plague.
He only uses it in quotes from other texts or very rarely as a synonym for
THIS creation, what is observed on this planet. And in that case only
I use it to differentiate what was created by our creator from what was created by
us. In general, I prefer to use the word “CREATION”.

The so-called "nature" is already in itself something SUPERNATURAL, because
was created. It seems to some that plants, animals, and
People were simply “born”, in quotes, ALONE. But if
analyzes the process, the need for a CREATOR is observed. That is why
your host prefers to use the word CREATION instead of the word
"nature".

In the same way as the word miracle, the word supernatural does not
has, for its host, a connotation of the inexplicable or
irrational. The fact that we do not know the explanation of something does not mean that
don't have it When we know our creator better we will know
best SUPERNATURAL processes.


HOME_SCRIPT
### Science.

Words like “science”, “knowledge”, “know”, “fact” in practice
They are related to the word “certainty”. Phrases like "is
scientifically proven”, “it is not that we believe it, it is that we know it”,
“I know him very well”, “that is a known fact” are used to
denote "certainty", to denote veracity in what is being said. The
The use of these words is related to the concept of Truth.

Ironically, the most popular criterion for solving the problem of
demarcation, that is, the criterion for determining whether a hypothesis is
scientific or not, is the “falsifiability” criterion, that is to say that said
hypothesis can be contradicted by observation or logic.
Just the opposite of "certainty": "Falsibility" implies the
absence of “certainty”. And all methods recognized as scientific
include being able to repeat the experimental observation of the results
expected for a falsifiable hypothesis.

Confidence is gained as experimentation can be repeated and
that is why the word “science” ends up being related to the
word "certainty" even though a scientific hypothesis must be
falsifiable to be scientific, according to the most popular criteria.

The problem with any scientific or non-scientific method is the same.
problem presented by any social, political, economic,
religious, educational, judicial, military, technological, scientific, etc.
The problem is the heart of man. The problem is with the user.
system or in the fundamental parts of the system. That user or those
parts of the system have a DECEPTIVE heart. There isn't a good one.

The human being can change, restructure, redesign the system that
whatever, but if its parts, the user, or the designer of it, are
damaged, then the system will fail.

Even the criteria presented in this video, technical creativity,
as a criterion for the demarcation problem, a criterion presented as
more reliable in determining whether a model or theory is scientific or not,
will also fail.

Technical creativity seems a stricter criterion than simple
repetition of observations because it only admits results
concrete, concrete objects, that have a function for the life of the
common person. It implies engineering, building something: airplanes, shoes,
cell phones, microscopes, telephones, watches, televisions, hammers,
trains, telescopes, computers, pots, buildings, transistors,
automobiles, satellites, refrigerators, washing machines, polishers, backhoe loaders,
MACHINES that make MACHINES, factories that use machines made by others
factories to build OBJECTS. If a discipline builds
repeatedly something useful for the human being, qualifies as
“knowledge” qualifies as “science”.

Technical creativity excludes any discipline that does not build its
object of study or something with its objects of study. Study the
stars but does not build them and does not build anything with them?. Do not
qualifies. He studies the elementary particles but doesn't he build them and doesn't
build anything with them? Does not qualify. He studies time but doesn't he?
builds and builds nothing with it?. Does not qualify. study gravity
but does not build it and does not build anything with it?. He doesn't qualify.
He studies the genes but does he build them for us and not build anything with
they?. Guess what?: DOES NOT QUALIFY.

That means that the scientific theories that speak of this type of
things are not so scientific. They are not really knowledge. They are a
field of study, are a set of hypotheses that have not been validated
for a TECHNICAL CREATIVITY.

In the criterion of technical creativity what is repeated is not a
observation but a usable object.

When it is rationally impossible to say: "I don't think we will travel to the
stars", when it is rationally impossible to say: "I do not believe in the
travel in time”, for the common person, in the same way in
that it is now rationally impossible to say: "I do not believe in airplanes",
For an ordinary person, we can say that technical creativity is already
confirmed the "scientific" theories that study space and time through
that level.

It seems more difficult for the technical creativity criterion to fail but
can fail. The problem is in the user. in the heart and mind
of the concept user.

It will always be possible to argue and debate that a theory was
completely necessary to build this or that object and try to
validate something that the one who first built it never thought of. Already
We are talking about the case of the transistor. Or will it always be possible to build something
from a partially understood phenomenon and then deny that it was
such knowledge is necessary in the construction of an object.

The technical creativity criterion may fail. The problem is in the
human heart. The creator warns us when he says, according to

### Distances.

Lights are seen in the sky. We perceive different frequencies of the
light they emit. How far away are they? The simplest answer is: NO
we know. But the human being instead of admitting his ignorance, he supposes,
assumes things it cannot confirm and draws conclusions based on that
assumptions.

Draw a dot on a sheet of paper. Put the sheet at a distance of
your arm, put a pencil between the sheet and your eyes. close your eye
left and open the right. Put the dot on the sheet behind the
tip of the pencil, that is: line up your right eye, the tip of
pencil and point on the sheet. Without moving head, pencil, or page,
now close the right eye and open the left. The pencil APPEARS to have
offset from the point on the sheet. With how many configurations?
distances of sheet, pencil and eyes can APPEAR that the pencil moves
the SAME distance? Answer: as many as you can count. For each one
the angle between the lines of sight of each eye to the OBJECT, that which
some call Parallax, it is different because it DEPENDS on the
distance from the sheet to the pencil, from the distance from the BACKGROUND to the OBJECT in
observation.

If this angle is to be calculated by measuring the angle of displacement
APPARENT of an object with respect to a background, one of two must be fulfilled: or
the distance from the background to the object is known or this distance must be
several orders of magnitude greater than the distance to be calculated in order to
get an approximate value. This second case is the origin of the
word Parallax, because it ASSUMES that the lines of sight from the point
of observation, in this case his eye, at the BACKGROUND, that which must be several
orders of magnitude farther than the distance to be calculated,
they are PARALLEL. Parallels are ASSUMED in order to approximate the angle
measured, which is the angle between the line of sight of one eye to the BACKGROUND and
the line of sight from the SAME eye to the OBJECT, to the angle between the lines
of vision of each eye, or points of observation, to the OBJECT.

The second option was the one used in the first approximate calculations.
the distance from the moon to the earth. The stars were the background and
these were ASSUMED several orders of magnitude more distant than the moon.
A reasonable assumption for the case of the moon.

Measure the apparent angle of displacement of an object relative to a
background of which we CANNOT assume that this SEVERAL orders of magnitude more
far that the object is TO ABUSE the approximation, it is TO ASSUME TOO MUCH.
It is no longer even an approximation, it is an uncertainty. Nevertheless
this is what is normally done to calculate the famous angle
Parallax with those lights that we see in the sky, with the stars.

Imagine putting the pencil 8 kilometers or 5 miles away from your
eyes and placing it between you and a star. The dot on the blade now
is the star. AND THEN TRY TO MEASURE THE ANGLE THAT THE PENCIL LOOKS LIKE
having moved with respect to the star when observing it from the second
eye, or when observing it with the best technology that can be imagined but
separating each observation only by 6 centimeters. And with that measurement
then calculate the distance from the pencil to your eyes using a calculation
trigonometric. Something like this would be what it is about to CALCULATE for the
Distance to the star believed to be closest to Earth, Alpha
Centaur. SOMETHING like this, because in this example the distance from the eye to the
star is actually larger, by several orders of magnitude, than the
distance from the eye to the pencil and the approximation of the measured angle to the angle
desired is still valid. Thing we don't know in the case of stars
respect to stars, that is to say the REAL case for Alpha Centauri, and the
approximation begins to be uncertainty.

The Parallax method is just an approximation and only works like
approximation if the measured angle can be approximated to the desired angle.
This is only possible if the BOTTOM is several orders of magnitude more
far than the distance to be measured. In the case of stars
rationally logical way to ASSUME is that the star for which you want
calculate the distance is much closer to the other stars than to
this planet, that is to say that in reality the star is part of the BACKGROUND
!

In the case of the stars there is no method of knowledge
public, that the man is using, to make the measurement of the angle
between the lines of sight of two observation points to a star
in particular. Maybe we just don't have the technology yet.
do it.

Another alarm on the use of the Parallax method to approximate the distance of
a star should be the value at such angles. are too much
little ones. And that in these attempts it is about separating the points of
observation as much as possible by making the observations at ends of the
cycle of the earth around the sun.

When the pencil is very far away the angle is very small. And when the
sheet is very close to the pencil, that is when the pencil begins to be
very close to the supposed bottom, it seems to move almost nothing. the background does not
It's as deep as we thought.

The minute angles measured in the case of stars, see
definition of arcsec, of APPARENT angular displacement with respect to a
SUPPOSED bottom of unknown distance, they should be more an indicative
that the star, for which I want to calculate the distance, is part
of the BOTTOM, and that therefore I cannot approximate the measured angle to the
angle between the two lines of sight to the star. ASSUME that is
take on too much.

Those angles are actually EVIDENCE against the approach and
hence the use of the method. Those angles are easily within
of the margin of error of the measurement of an angle between two stars,
when these measurements are made one in spring and one in autumn, it is
say at two opposite ends of the earth's cycle around the
sun.

This Parallax method that assumes too much and is used to make a
APPROXIMATE and INDIRECT CALCULATION of the distance of a star is what
astronomy, cosmology, and the so-called sciences that study
stars, they call DIRECT MEASUREMENT of stellar distances. make me the
favour !. That's the DIRECT one! To make an APPROXIMATE and INDIRECT CALCULATION
we call it that it is said to MEASURE DIRECTLY! It's the best we have.
Now imagine the INDIRECT measurements.

Based on these approximate and indirect calculations for the objects that
we believe that they can be calculated, those that we believe are closest, which are
less than 0.07% of related objects and less than 0 POINT
000000000000, 22 ZEROS, one, percent, of those believed to be
visible in the universe, it begins to build what is known as the
cosmic distance ladder. Which is nothing more than a ladder
more ASSUMPTIONS with which the other distances are intended to be established
cosmic lights that we observe in the sky. assumptions about
assumptions about assumptions.

With instruments built with the highest human technology and
making a series of assumptions that so far are
completely impossible to confirm, unless we find a way
of traveling to the stars, we believe that we know, that we know, that
we are certain, THAT is the ATTITUDE we have, of which is the
distance that has a light that we observe in the sky.

The truth is that we do not know.

We cannot reach The Truth of the very far, without having contact with
SHE.

### Redshift.

To calculate approximations of the distance of a star sometimes
we assume that larger size means greater closeness, sometimes we assume
that luminously connected objects are at the same distance, sometimes
we assume that greater luminosity perceived as emitted by the object
implies less distance, sometimes we suppose the mechanisms by means of which
which light is emitted, and we sometimes assume that higher redshift
implies a greater distance, and based on these assumptions
unconfirmable we do a whole series of calculations to arrive at
conclusions that we accept as true.

But for the sake of argument let us ASSUME, BELIEVE, ACCEPT that
ALL, absolutely ALL, those ASSUMPTIONS are true.

In the last millennium it was concluded that the universe is
expanding because one of those assumptions tells us that: the
redshift of a group of objects, or of an object, is greater
the greater the distance from the object.

But what happens when luminously CONNECTED objects are found?
but with DIFFERENT redshifts? What about NGC-7603 or
NGC-4319 in which several objects are luminously CONNECTED but
have DIFFERENT redshifts? Simple. are ignored because
They imply that the assumptions contradict each other. And that implies
that the conclusions are FALSE.

What happens when you plot "apparent brightness" against
"redshifts" of the Quasars we observe and it is found that
the points in the diagram are SPREAD throughout the entire diagram and do not
show a statistical correlation? Simple. They are ignored. Because
They imply that the assumptions contradict each other. And that implies
that the conclusions are FALSE.

If the assumption that the "redshift" tells us
"distance", is FALSE, so the MAIN argument for a universe
expanding is FALSE.

An expanding universe is the main argument for the famous
Big-Bang, that explosion of absolutely NOTHING, because before the
explosion there was NOTHING, and from which EVERYTHING supposedly came out. An
logical absurdity that even today some accept without any
problem because it was what they taught him in school: that EVERYTHING came out of
an explosion of NOTHING.

The evidence shown by Quasars that the "redshift"
It does NOT indicate "distance" it is evidence that destroys the main argument
to conclude that the universe is expanding. which in turn is the
main argument to conclude that it all started with a bang. What
in turn, it is the main basis for calculating its time of existence. What
in turn is an argument for … blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

WE DO NOT KNOW the distances of those lights that we see in the sky, but
we are so proud, so haughty, so arrogant, so arrogant, so
exalted, so rebellious, that we refuse to admit our ignorance.
We draw conclusions from an expanding universe based on assumptions
that we cannot confirm, and that on the contrary we have found very
strong evidence that they falsify them, and we call the process SCIENCE!
Do me a favor!

The Truth of the far away we cannot reach if we do not have contact
with her.

### Radioactive.

For any supposed radiometric dating, we start from the following
assumptions:

1. Assuming initial conditions are known.
2. Assuming that there are no external effects that alter the conditions
    of the chemical elements measured.
3. Assuming that the rate of change, of radioactivity, of the
    measured chemical elements has been maintained.

So:

I can calculate when these rocks or objects containing
these radioactive elements.

Dating by radioactive elements is one of the most ABSURD ways
of using high technology to obtain completely useless results
because it assumes too many things impossible to verify.

But for the sake of argument let us ASSUME, BELIEVE, ACCEPT that
ALL, absolutely ALL, these ASSUMPTIONS are valid.

The rate of decay in these radioactive elements is sought
approximate by measuring how often the radioactive element is
decreases to half. This data is called the half-life of the element.
radioactive.

It is ASSUMED that the radioactive element is always decaying at the same rate.
velocity. The half-life of the radioactive element is assumed to be unchanged.
That it has been the same throughout history and during the
supposed billions of years that take some rocks thrown by
there.

ACCEPTING the necessary assumptions, with this half-life one can
determine what is the maximum amount of time that can elapse before
that the atoms, actually isotopes, of an initial quantity of said
radioactive element, lose the electrons that make it radioactive and
said isotope decays into an atom or isotope that is no longer radioactive,
because the energy in electrons is compensated by the energy of the nucleus.
When that happens the name of the element changes. It's not the same anymore
element because these are identified by the number of protons and
electrons. That is to say that the radioactive element ends up disappearing,
because its isotopes decayed into atoms or isotopes of another element. A
Sometimes it is a chain of decays because not always an element
radioactive decays into a stable element but into another that is also radioactive.

But what happens when for the SAME piece of rock, to which are applied
several and DIFFERENT methods of radioactive dating, are obtained
results that are multiples, MULTIPLES, eye MULTIPLES, of each other?
We ignore it, because this would mean that our assumptions are
false. And that NONE of the dates are reliable.

ACCEPTING all necessary assumptions, for the most famous of all
radioactive elements, Carbon 14, it has been calculated that said life
average is about 5730 years. Carbon 14 decays into Nitrogen
14 by losing an electron and releasing energy in the form of light. And for those
practical measurement purposes, and ACCEPTING all assumptions
necessary, the maximum time of existence of said radioactive element
in any sample it is 60 thousand years.

This means that if the sample is more than 60 thousand years old, it is no longer
expect to find absolutely NOTHING of Carbon 14 because everything will be
decayed into Nitrogen 14.

But, what happens when an animal THAT HAS JUST DIED is
Carbon 14 test and it turns out that he supposedly lived thousands of years ago
years? We ignore it, because it would mean that our assumptions are
false and that the method does not work.

Or, what happens when the Carbon 14 test is done on two parts of the
SAME animal and the results have differences of thousands of years? It
we ignore, because it would mean that our assumptions are false and
that the method does not work, or that a part of the animal lived thousands of
years before the other, which is just absurd.

Or what happens when a part of a LIVING animal, eye that is ALIVE, is
does the Carbon 14 test and it turns out that he supposedly lived a
thousands of years? We ignore it, because it would mean that our
assumptions are false and that the method does not work.

Or, what happens when a SAME piece of animal is dated?
by Carbon 14 in different laboratories and one age turns out to be less
20,000 years old and the other older than 28,000 years? We ignore it because
would mean that our assumptions are false and that the method does not
works.

Radiometric dating DOES NOT WORK.

But for the sake of argument let us ASSUME, BELIEVE, ACCEPT that
it works. LET'S ASSUME it works like a charm.

What happens when every time a Carbon 14 test is performed on
some piece of carbon on the planet we find that has has Carbon
14? We ignore it, because it would mean that, according to the assumptions of the
radiometric dating, those pieces of carbon CANNOT be more than
60 thousand years. And we don't like it because, if we don't believe the bible, we want
believe what we were taught in school.

Or what happens when every time a Carbon 14 test is performed on
any piece of diamond we find that has Carbon 14? We ignore it
because it would mean that, according to the assumptions of the datings
radiometric, those pieces of diamond CANNOT have more than 60 thousand
years. And we don't like it because, if we don't believe the bible, we want to believe the
that we were taught in school.

Or what happens when every time a Carbon 14 test is performed on
dinosaur fossils we find that have Carbon 14? We ignore it
because it would mean that, according to the assumptions of the datings
radiometric, those dinosaur fossils CANNOT be more than 60 thousand
years. And we don't like it because, if we don't believe the bible, we want to believe the
that we were taught in school.

We cannot reach The Truth of the ancient past when we assume something
which cannot be verified at present.

### Helium.

Helium is a gas that escapes from practically any container.
And the higher the temperature, the easier it is to escape.

If we find helium-filled balloons on the ceiling of a room where there were
a children's party, we asked what time the party was and we
respond that it was 8 days ago, we know there is evidence indicating the
contrary. The helium filled balloons would be on the floor and not on the
ceiling.

Of course, this conclusion implies having made some assumptions
similar to radiometric dating: that the temperature of helium
in the balloons has not varied in large quantities, that the balloons have not
been refilled with helium, and that the balloons were already filled with
helium when the children's party happened.

Zircon is a mineral found in granite and other types
of rocks. That is to say that this zircon is spread all over the planet in
every mountain that has granite. That zircon is found in any
part of the earth's crust. The one that is made of granite.

And similar to what we did with the dating assumptions by
Carbon 14, LET US ASSUME, ACCEPT, BELIEVE that the assumptions of the
Uranium dating on these bits of zircon hold, and LET'S ASSUME
that the Helium in those bits of zircon is generated when the Uranium that
was in the zircon decays into Lead.

What happens when we find Helium in those pieces of zircon that have
been dated to billions of years and were found
temperatures between 100 and 270 degrees Celsius between 1000 and
4000 meters deep in the earth's crust?

What happens is that we have evidence that indicates that this granite cannot
have been formed before a few thousand years ago. If they had
after only a few hundred thousand years, there would be nothing,
absolutely NO Helium in those zircon bits. That is to say that with
that Helium in that Zircon we have evidence that the earth's crust,
that is made of that granite that contains that zircon, has only
a few thousand years and not billions of years as we
they taught at school.

Either the assumptions on which the datings are based are not fulfilled.
Uranium, or there should be absolutely NO Helium in those chunks
of Zircon.

The Truth of the ancient past is unattainable when we assume things that
cannot be verified at present.

### Factories.

Imagine a factory that produces cars. a completely factory
automated without human intervention. This factory produces all the
energy it consumes. It has its own power generators, its
own mechanisms of storage and internal transport of energy,
and its own mechanism for using said energy. Any interaction with the
exterior is controlled by automatic systems. You can verify
quantity and quality in the income of each of the inputs used
through specialized gates for each input. It has machines
that can build and deconstruct paths of travel for
machines you need to operate. This factory has machines that
operating together, they can build each of the machines that
needs to operate, including themselves. The cars that
produces are verified by machines and corrections can be made
Minor details after fabrication. Has automated mechanisms
quality control, input and output control, transport and
communication of information and energy. It also has machines that
they can repair damage anywhere in the factory. These machines
can repair any machine or transportation system,
communication, energy production, distribution, production,
manufacturing, control, support, its physical structures, etc.
These machines can repair any part of the factory. This
factory can even, in an emergency, go into standby mode.
self destruction. It is a factory that does not need human intervention.
Fully automated.

Imagine that this factory is so automated that it can copy itself
same. You can start building all your machines internally,
begin to separate at one end of its internal structure these machines
and end up building another separate physical structure with exactly
the same characteristics as itself. Another factory just like itself.
All the information, all the programs, all the mechanisms of
control of how to do it are within the factory itself. Does not need
communicate with the outside to perform the duplication task. Only
needs the same inputs that it receives to manufacture automobiles for
able to duplicate itself.

Now imagine that this factory cannot be seen with the naked eye
because it is too small, a microscope is needed. has only
a few thousand cubic micrometers in volume. And the cars that
produces are a few thousand cubic nanometers in volume.

The cars produced by this factory have a respective speed
to its size 3 times greater than that of a car in common use by human beings
humans. In addition, their work efficiency, regarding the amount of
energy used for its operation, is 60%. That is to say that it is
much greater than the efficiency of a car in common use by beings
humans, which only has a 10% efficiency with respect to the amount
of energy used for its operation.

Now let us take a car in common use by human beings and
Let's take it apart: piece by piece, nut by nut, bolt by bolt,
circuit by circuit.

Suppose each part is carefully numbered, each circuit
carefully specified and numbered, suppose we have a
fully illustrated instruction manual, which we have videos
illustrating how to assemble each of its parts, and what
we have all the necessary tools to assemble each part
and the tools needed to put it back together. Do you think that
would you need additional help to put it together? Could you put it together? As soon as
weather?

What would happen if you do not have the numbering of the pieces and the
circuits but does it have everything else? Could you still put it together? And yes
didn't have the instructions? And without the videos? could i still
arm it? And without the tools? What if the pieces were not in the
same place, but scattered all over the planet? Could you still put it together?
What if you had to build the pieces from the elements of the
periodic table? What if as time passes the pieces that already
put together tend to fall apart, or rust, or get damaged, or just plain
grow old? What if the only thing you can do to make a decision
building a piece is tossing a coin to see if it comes out
heads or tails? What if you, the one who puts it together, have no intelligence, no
will, or creativity, or ability to make decisions? YET
COULD YOU SET IT UP?

Because more or less that is what they teach us in school that happened
with machines that we don't even understand how they work. All the
biological machinery.

Remember that we are only trying to put together a car for common use
by human beings. That we understand how it works. In the case of assembling
a human being we are talking about an organism that in the vast majority
of its factories, of its cells, it has all the information on how
build the whole organism. That the whole organism came out of a single
factory, a single cell, a fertilized egg. that these cells
can take on different functions, contextures, to form parts of
each of the systems. Digestive, endocrine, immune system,
circulatory, nervous, bone, muscular, respiratory, etc. A system
that also presents consciousness, intelligence, creativity, ability to
create automobiles to use as a means of transportation. such a machine
complex that we do not even understand how to build the most elementary of
its parts: the cell.

In the story that they put us in from school, not only that car
common use was put together with a lot of time and pure hump, but also the one that
created that car was put together the same way.

The field of study called abiogenesis is now in charge of giving
a scientific touch to that tale.

### Monomers.

Monomers are the letters and pieces of biological systems.

The person who intends to explain the process by which he can
arise life from matter, without the existence of a creator, has to
explain how to form organic compounds from the table
periodic. It is the minimum.

If an intelligent, designer and creative being as he calls himself the
Human beings cannot chemically synthesize an organic compound
from the periodic table, if that being such an intelligent designer and
creative cannot BUILD what was supposedly formed
“SPONTANEOUSLY”, a word that those people love to repeat
who claim such an explanation, much less can it arise “magically”,
sorry I meant "spontaneously", said organic compound.

Abiogenesis is the field of study that aims to explain the origin of
life from lifeless matter.

One of the goals of abiogenesis is to explain the process, BEFORE
the existence of biochemistry, BEFORE the existence of compounds
organic, through which said organic compounds were formed at
from the elements of the periodic table.

Another of the objectives of abiogenesis is to explain how to build, how
synthesize, how to arm, how to assemble, a cell.

#### The letters.

The simplest organic compounds, necessary and present in all
biological systems, those that are absolutely necessary for
start building a living cell, there are basically 4 types of monomers:

1. monosaccharides,
2. amino acids,
3. the nucleotides and
4. glycerol.

These are the parts of the machines, and the letters of the programs, that
They allow cells to be assembled.

The machines and programs needed to build a cell are
basically 4 types of polymers:

1. Carbohydrates,
2. Peptides,
3. Nucleic acids, and
4. Lipids.

Each of these polymers are assembled from monomers. Cop
means many. Monkey means one. A cop is armed with several monkeys.
A “many” is made up of several “ones”. Easy right?

1. Carbohydrates are made of monosaccharides.
2. Peptides or proteins are made from amino acids.
3. Nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides.
4. Lipids are made from glycerol.

#### Gloves.

You cannot put a left hand glove on your hand.
right, this is because the mirror image of your left hand
cannot be superimposed on his right hand. When a chemical compound
presents this characteristic is said to be CHIRAL. And when in one
sample of a chemical compound there is only one type of chirality, all
are they gloves for the right hand or are they all gloves for the left,
the sample is said to be HOMOCHIRAL. When there are gloves for the right
and gloves for the left mixed in the sample, it is said that the
sample is racemic.

The monomers, those pieces and letters, those that are of 4 types:
monosaccharides, amino acids, nucleotides and glycerol, which are observed
in biological systems, they have that characteristic they are HOMOCHIRAL.
They are all gloves for the same hand. The letters and the pieces with the
that the machines and programs that are observed in the cells are assembled are
homochiral.

#### Reactions.

Each chemical reaction has different necessary conditions for
temperature, acidity, pressure, electromagnetic radiation, energy,
purity in the reagents, etc. so that it can be given.

Some reactions require the presence of specific compounds
that facilitate them although they do not participate in the reaction. they need
facilitators.

Some reactions need to be stopped because if they continue they will not be
gets the expected result. They need a change in conditions
to stop the reaction. They need a brake at the right time.

Some reactions result in a mixture of several compounds
where only one of them is desired and may be in a ratio
very small compared to the total result. It may happen that only 1% of
the mixture is the compound that is desired. And it is necessary to separate said
desired compound by some additional procedure that is sometimes
it is simply not known, it is not known how to separate it from what is not
you want, from the trash. Garbage is not wanted.

Some reactions do not work in reverse. They only work on one
address.

Some reactions require certain parts of the reactant to be
protected, so that the reaction occurs only in the part where it is desired.
Something like putting on shoes and a glove on your right hand so that the
union with the other, that desired link, is only by the left hand
and not by any other extremity. This implies preparation prior to
the reaction of each of the reactants. sometimes it takes
protection.

Once you have a reaction, you need to show that if
he got what he wanted and in what quantities. This process is called
characterization. And many times it is even more complex than the same
reaction.

#### Easy.

What happens then when in the field of abiogenesis, it is intended
explain how these letters and fundamental pieces were formed, those
first organic compounds that are monosaccharides, amino acids,
nucleotides and glycerol, on a DEAD and GROSS planet where there was no
laboratories, and for my next step in my chain of reactions
chemicals I need the result of my previous step to be in the form
homochiral, that has the necessary purity, suitably protected
for the following reaction to occur, conveniently separated from other
compounds, with the conditions of temperature, pressure, acidity, etc. Y
the ongoing reaction has not stopped, my desired compound is
being mixed with 4 other garbage compounds and in a proportion
less than 1% of the amount I need, which I have no idea
how to separate it from the garbage compounds, which is remaining in the form
racemic and not homochiral as I need it, that my reaction has no
reverse and even though I am in my modern laboratory with all the
technology that the intelligence, design and creativity of the human being has
been able to build, I have no idea how to make that compound that if
I can extract from biological systems by procedures
destructive that if we have managed to develop?

Easy. First I cheat and extract it from biological systems
existing, those that I intend to demonstrate how they were formed, through the
destructive procedures that we have developed to extract
these compounds. Something like destroying a car to remove the
tires that I need, those that I think were put together by themselves in millions
of years.

Then, using other organic compounds also extracted from systems
biological, I protect it in the parts that need protection for my
next step. I do all the steps the same way. And finally
I write an article omitting those little details, like the need
of a human controlling the conditions of the reactions, and
announcing that the goal has already been achieved.

And this is just to show that you can, in a modern laboratory and
with human intervention, build the letters and pieces of the programs
and machines that we find in cells.

That is the truth of the lie, the trap, and the deceit, of those
articles on abiogenesis.

### Polymers.

Polymers are the machines and programs of biological systems.
They are made of monomers.

1. Carbohydrates are made of monosaccharides.
2. Peptides or proteins are made from amino acids.
3. Nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides.
4. Lipids are made from glycerol.

The human being is not capable of synthesizing the monomers that make up the
essential polymers to build a cell without using what is already in
living cells, in existing biological systems, those that pretend
show how they were formed.

But LET'S SUPPOSE, LET'S ACCEPT, LET'S BELIEVE that yes, that man can already
build monomers without using compounds extracted from systems
biological. Which can synthesize monosaccharides, amino acids, nucleotides
and glycerol. That is the least of the problems.

If you intend to deny the creator, the human being would have to at least,
using all your intelligence, design and creativity, using all your
technology, using modern laboratories, those that do not have a planet
DEAD and GROSS in which everything supposedly happened SPONTANEOUSLY,
develop chemical procedures that allow reproducing at least the
simplest polymers observed in biological systems.
Polymers for which the sequence is already known, without having to
design it, with which a cell is built: carbohydrates,
peptides, nucleic acids and lipids. Of the cell that considers more
simple, the easiest of all, the one you want, the one you choose.

Can not.

It's your turn to cheat. It is up to him to extract the machines and programs from the
existing biological systems for use in the synthesis of said
polymers. Those you supposedly want to prove appeared in a
DEAD and GROSS planet millions of years ago at the end of time, hump and
chemical reactions that supposedly occur SPONTANEOUSLY but
man can not even do with the latest technology and using
all his creativity, intelligence and design.

With those letters and pieces that are monosaccharides, amino acids,
nucleotides and glycerol should be able to assemble at least the
carbohydrates, peptides, nucleic acids, and lipids of the cell
simple.

I should be able to synthesize them. You should be able to polymerize them. Can not. You
it's time to cheat. And yet the popular explanation, the one we read
in the encyclopedia, is that they arose SPONTANEOUSLY. Lonely puffs.

The machines that man can create to join letters of a program
biological are the size of a REFRIGERATOR and can only join a maximum of 15
to 20 letters before they start having the same problems, in their
chemical reactions that the human being has to synthesize the
monomers.

The longest program that man can synthesize with his machines
It goes up to about 20 letters. If you want longer chains, you have to use
the machines of biological systems. You have to use carbohydrates,
peptides, nucleic acids destructively extracted from systems
biological.

In fact, it's your turn to cheat more, because let's remember that we're
accepting the trap that said letters were extracted from systems
biological and adequately protected using organic compounds
also extracted from biological systems.

A biological program for a single cell has hundreds of thousands of
letters and machines found in biological systems
they are so small in size that hundreds of thousands of these machines can fit
in a single cell.

We are nowhere near being able to synthesize the polymers needed to
build a cell We can not even accepting as if we could
What we can't do: Synthesize the monomers.

We cannot even knowing the information that describes the
structure of these polymers. But supposedly a DEAD planet and
GROSS if he could. Supposedly it all happened SPONTANEOUSLY millions of years ago
of years. That is what they teach you in school and they repeat it to you in
University. poof. Solitos.

### Programmer.

The human being is not even capable of synthesizing essential polymers
similar to those needed to build a cell, without using what is already
there are in living cells, in existing biological systems, those that
aims to show how they were formed magically, sorry, spontaneous.

But LET'S SUPPOSE, LET'S ACCEPT, LET'S BELIEVE that yes, that man can already
build, synthesize, polymers resembling those essential for
build a cell, without using compounds extracted from systems
biological. SUPPOSE that if you can synthesize carbohydrates, peptides,
nucleic acids and lipids.

That is just the second challenge. That's just the power to write.

The most important question of all is what are you going to write?

Programs are not written by themselves. And much less random,
randomly, hump. Some think so and try to prove it
writing programs. Programs that didn't write themselves either.
Absurd, right? Programs that seek to be random using a MACHINE.
Using something completely deterministic like a computer. Plus
absurd, right? Using functions that pretend to be random, functions
pseudo-random, “almost” but “NOT” random.

The mathematical question of whether there is a fair currency, one that is not
loaded, a truly random function, the one that is no longer pseudo,
that which is no longer quasi-random but IS random, is considered a
open problem. It is considered a problem that has not been resolved. Neither
for YES, nor for NO. It shouldn't be because it's equivalent to trouble
that YES have been resolved. Does not exist. Don't look for it. There is a Creator.

But SUPPOSE, ACCEPT, BELIEVE, with the spirit of argument, that
the human being uses any tool he wants, not necessarily
organic polymers, to write the program you want and how
want.

The program that the human being should be able to write, using all his
intellectual capacity, creativity and design, that which does not have the
supposed DEAD and GROSS planet in which supposedly everything happened
SPONTANEOUSLY, it would be one who can at least do what he himself
human being does. I should be able to simulate, mimic, what a brain does
human. The famous artificial intelligence. One who passes the test
Turing. One who learns to learn. One that processes information from
indistinguishable way to how a human being does.

We could not.

But LET US SUPPOSE, LET'S ACCEPT, LET'S BELIEVE, that yes, that the human being has already achieved
create a program that processes information in a manner indistinguishable from
like a human being does.

In that hypothetical case, in which you need to BELIEVE and SUPPOSE more than you
What is needed to BELIEVE that Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected,
The ONLY thing that will have been shown is that to create a REAL intelligence
needs ANOTHER.

The ONLY thing you will have demonstrated is the need for a programmer, the
NEED of a CREATOR.

That Creator didn't just design the DNA program. DNA is just
Program. The machine on which it is going to be executed is needed, and said
machine needs energy and the right environment so that it can
run the program. The fertilized egg needs the uterus.

This factory that is the fertilized ovum begins to subdivide following
the specific program and after nine months we have, only in the
brain, a program that we have no idea how it works. And not
we can't even mimic it with our best technology.

But no, some people come to believe, because that is what
taught as children in school, that a DEAD and GROSS planet turned out
more alive and intelligent than us. Absurd, right? But that's how we are.

A person about 3 thousand years ago understood it better than many
modern scientists. Psalm 100 tells us: “Recognize
that the LORD is God: He made us, and not we ourselves."

### The story of the frog.

One of the most famous tales is that of the toad that becomes
the prince. It is a story for children.

The same story but adding millions of years is that of evolution.
Man evolved from a reptile in millions of years.

Any method recognized as scientific must start from evidence
observable.

There is NO, ZERO, NOTHING OBSERVABLE evidence that a class
animal, a feline, a canine, an equine, transform, evolve,
change over time in another class.

In the examples of change that those who believe the
story, the animal NEVER changes class.

Bacteria are still bacteria, birds are still
birds, turtles are still turtles, fish are still
fish, insects are still insects, canines are still
canines, equines are still equines and felines are still
felines

And in the most modern examples that claim to show genetic changes,
is simply the same animal without a member, with the member
impaired, or with a member in the wrong place.

Some fossils of bones that supposedly carry
there millions of years, but let us remember they have Carbon 14, that Carbon
14 that supposedly can't be there if something died more than 60 thousand ago
years, and with those stones they put together a story of the imagination that lasts
millions of years.

It is impossible to OBSERVE, that which requires any method that is
Consider yourself a scientist, change. It is impossible to observe
because supposedly it happened millions of years ago and it is not possible
reproduce it in ANY laboratory because the change supposedly
also occurs in millions of years.

There is no OBSERVABLE evidence of a change from one kind of animal to another.

The only thing that is observed is adaptation. That happens even with being
human. But no one argues that a short person is short.
different class to a person with tall stature. only one person who
believe the tale of the toad can consider that a person with black skin
it is of a different kind than a white-skinned one.

The modern classification according to a species is completely arbitrary,
there are more than ten different definitions of the word, and the only thing that
achieves is to differentiate the ramifications of the ADAPTATION that has had
the same kind of animal.

Canines are still canines, equines are still equines, and
cats are still cats

The supposed evolution of the species, the one that changes class, the one that
they call macro-evolution, the one that supposedly was the original, I don't know
can OBSERVE anywhere. It is an imaginary tale. There is not
OBSERVABLE evidence of class change.

Bacteria are still bacteria, birds are still
birds, turtles are still turtles, fish are still
fish, insects are still insects, canines are still
canines, equines are still equines and felines are still
felines

On the contrary, it has been observed on multiple occasions that when two
of these ADAPTATIONS begin to coexist in the same environment for a
long period of time, say forty years, it is observed that
They are able to cross each other.

The large amount of genetic information that differs between two classes
different types of animals was ignored during the last century as part
descriptive of the kind of animal and only recently has it been observed
as it intervenes in the process of gestation of the animal. He was considered
Junk DNA, once used during those supposed millions of years
for one kind of animal to evolve into another. Evolution of which
There is NO OBSERVABLE evidence, because it supposedly happens in millions of
years and supposedly it happened millions of years ago, and we cannot
OBSERVE today. A tale of man's imagination.

We were also taught in school that some organs, of which
we did not know their function, and that they are found in biological systems
current, were completely unnecessary and were there to
remind us of those millions of years of evolution. We were taught that
appendix only to come to discover a few years later that it is part
of the immune or immune system. We were taught that about the coccyx, only
to come to discover, a few years later, its function as termination and
support of a multitude of ligaments and muscles. We were taught that
Whales and other aquatic animals have small bones that
are vestiges of what once were a pelvis and legs, only
to come and discover the important role they play in the
mating of these animals.

Perhaps, suddenly, perhaps, who knows, the people who believe the
tale of the frog should begin to consider the possibility that
simply the story NEVER HAPPENED. That the reason there is NO
OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE of transformation, of evolution, of classes of
animals, it is not only that it is intended to know the film of assumptions
billions of years looking at just the last photo. but said
transformation NEVER HAPPENED. There was NEVER evolution. They were NOT thousands of
millions of years. But the movie alone is thousands of years old. Y
it began when the Creator so decided. And all kinds of animals
they were physically created at the same time.

But no. It continues with the tales to endure a tale of a toad
who became a prince. Only in millions of millions of years
to make it look believable.

### Trees.

Fossils of trees are found in geological strata in position
vertical. The same fossil crosses several layers or geological strata
that supposedly took millions of years to form.

The traditional explanation of how this happened is that for those, and only
for those trees, geological events that we see today, of
quick deposit or several small ones were the ones who buried said
trees. Examples of such events include volcanic deposits,
deltaic deposits and glacial deposits. That was a volcano, that was a
river, that was a glacial. That is to say that for those and only for those
trees, the geological strata formed quickly and not in
millions of years. But yes, not by accident is it considered that the
evidence is perfectly consistent with a flood event
planetary.

But what happens when not all tree fossils are in position?
vertical, when some are root up? What if
is the famous Carbon 14 found in these fossils? That Carbon 14 that
supposedly it can't be there if a tree died and started to
fossilize more than 60 thousand years ago, what happens when this happens in
strata that were already classified as being millions of years old?

Nothing, they ignore each other. The evidence is simply as if it did not exist. It is
too contradictory even with the same assumptions of what is
called evidence.

The story of the toad that becomes a prince is still held,
because it is the only alternative to admitting the existence of a Creator.

### Coal.

The explanation taught even in online encyclopedias is that
the formation of the carbon that we observe on the planet took millions of
years of plant debris that accumulated under water and clay. And that
said remains were buried by sediments, and then, supposedly
over millions of years of high pressures and temperatures produced
burial caused the loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide.
carbon, and this loss increased the proportion of carbon, and voila. Easy
not?

But what happens when we find coal reserves of 26 thousand
square kilometers, with carbon bands, low in impurities and low
in sulfur, 61 meters thick, hundreds of kilometers long, and
almost 80 kilometers wide? How to explain that they kept the
conditions necessary to form them over millions of years? Why not
the bands were diluted in fluxes of clay or other impurities before
thicken? What happens when Carbon 14 is found inside that
carbon?, that Carbon 14 that supposedly cannot be there if something
is more than 60 thousand years old? What happens when contrails are found?
radiation ovals within the coal indicating rapid formation
and simultaneously with the coal because these trails opened dissipated,
faded or cracked if the coal formation had taken
million years or it would not have been simultaneous with the wakes? What's happening
when carbon is formed from wood in the presence of water,
absence of air, at 160 degrees centigrade, high pressures, and with so
only two weeks of waiting?

Any. No problem. The topic is ignored. The evidence is just like
if I do not exist. It is too contradictory even with the same
assumptions of what is called evidence.

The story of the toad that becomes a prince is still held,
because it is the only alternative to admitting the existence of a Creator.

### Tectonics.

A series of characteristics are observed on the planet in the land and the
ocean. Mountains, lakes, volcanoes on land and ocean, large
deposits of minerals and organic compounds, large canyons, trenches
oceanic ridges, mid-ocean ridges, a granite crust covering
partially the planet, etc.

In the last century, seeking to explain what we observe and using
too much imagination proposed the theory of tectonic plates. A
theory that proposes a series of mechanisms such as the expansion of the
marine, subduction, mountain building, mantle circulation, points
hot, transform faults, inversion of magnetic poles of the
planet, in short, a whole series of mechanisms that NEVER, eye NEVER,
They have NEVER been observed.

NONE of these supposed processes have EVER been measured. no evidence
OBSERVABLE that these processes happen.

The apology is the same as the one in the story of the frog, the one in the story of the
macroevolution: is that they happen in billions of years.

It happens to tectonic plate theory that it assumes too much, that
imagine too much. The same thing happens to him as to all the other theories that are
support in the present to imagine, his followers call him "deduce",
in quotes, the past.

With a photo of the present, a movie of billions is imagined
from years of the past.

There is NO OBSERVABLE evidence of the highly imaginative mechanisms that
they supposedly explain what we do observe. The photo of the present. These
mechanisms are supposedly deduced from the vivid imagination of those who
they raised them.

That happens because when it comes to denying the Creator you have to have a
much larger imagination than is needed to believe that
Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected.

Do not confuse the plates that are IMAGINED with the crust of
GRANITE that IS observed and the terrestrial mantle of SILICATES that IS
observe.

The granite crust that we have been able to observe, which is known as
continental crust, corresponds to the dry land that we observe
above sea level and extends partially as a border in
the oceans to what is known as the “continental shelf”. The
granite crust is on average 40 km thick and is composed of
Mainly granite and sediments.

Not all of the Earth's mantle is covered by the granite crust.
continental crust. In the oceans, parts of the mantle are only
covered by sediment and water. This layer is known as the layer
1 of the oceanic crust that it actually includes in its layers 2 and 3
part of the earth's mantle.

The mantle is that terrestrial layer that we can OBSERVE, which is composed
of silicates, which is about 2,900 kilometers thick, and which
surrounds the core, the center of the planet.

That is what we observe: a granite crust, layers of
sediments and the thickest layer of all, formed by silicates, which
we call mantle. Not even what we call the core of the planet has been
directly observed.

On the other hand, the supposed tectonic plates have an average of 125 km
thick, almost 85 km on average, supposedly thicker than the
granite crust. These so-called plates are composed of crust
continental, oceanic crust and an arbitrary upper part of the
terrestrial mantle, each one decides how much it includes, or not, as part of
each plate. Assemble your tectonic plate. That is, the thickness of the
supposed plates is formed by an arbitrary mixture of layers
terrestrial, clearly distinguished in their chemical composition, which IF
they observe.

The Earth's mantle is about 2900 kilometers thick of silicates
in the form of a rock and each imaginary plate supposedly has in its part
innermost about 85 km from the top of the mantle.

These plates do NOT correspond to the dry land that we observe
above sea level but with an arbitrary division that changes both
How does the division into continents change? Some admit more plates others
Fewer plates are allowed.

In addition, the supposed plates penetrate the ocean much more than the
granite crust that YES we can observe until we reach the "ridges"
oceanic”, which we can also observe, and that is where they imagine that
such tectonic plates are formed. That is, another limitation
completely arbitrary, this time in the area covered by the supposed
tectonic plates.

Plate tectonics cannot be OBSERVED because the assumptions
processes that would allow us to identify its limits, its edges,
they supposedly happen in hundreds of millions of years and we haven't been that long
in the planet.

With a photo of the present they imagine a movie of billions
from years of the past.

#### Pits.

The vast majority of ocean trenches are found in the Pacific Ocean.
of the planet. The imagination of man has posited that these pits
formed when one plate was pushed under another in a process that
has called subduction. Subduction is the putative mechanism that
explains the formation of the oceanic trenches of the Pacific.

Today's seismic tomography should show clear images in 3
dimensions of gigantic plates that supposedly have a thickness
average of 14 times the height of Everest, about 125 kilometers
thickness, penetrating one below the other in each zone, eye IN EACH ZONE,
NOT in a single one that has been manipulated, where there is an oceanic trench
In the pacific. There are not. They imagine them.

A single zone, explainable by a global flood event, with
images that are by no means conclusive, they manipulate her to make believe that
meets the conditions, and generalize that the same thing happens in ALL
other areas where there SHOULD be clear seismic tomography images and
three-dimensional of the supposed subductions that of course do not
we have.

If we are supposed to be able to measure a displacement of up to
maximum 10 CENTIMETERS per year, carefully measured with technology
which normally has a margin of error of 15 METERS, that is to say a
margin of error almost 100 times BIGGER than what you want to measure, in
the planet's crust which is on average 15 kilometers thick,
eye on the CRUST, NOT on some supposed plates that they want to make us
believe that they exist and that they are supposedly almost 10 times thicker than
the earth's crust, if we are really able to measure said
displacement of the crust, why are we not able to observe the
supposed subduction of the supposed plates? The apology is the same
always: it happens in hundreds of millions of years. The people that
they simply repeat the story they were taught, as if they were parrots,
they should consider the possibility that it just doesn't happen.

But the story of the subduction, that a plate of 125 kilometers of
thick, which does not correspond to observable characteristics but
imagined, which penetrates under another of a similar thickness, in addition
presents other serious logical problems in explaining, as claimed,
the oceanic trenches of the Pacific that we DO observe.

What is the mechanism that makes the plates move? Which is the
driving force? Why is NO movement or flow observed at all?
the mantle of the planet? If volcanoes occur under the plate
superior by the magma generated in the friction of the two plates when
the supposed subduction or penetration, how to explain that the volcanoes
are on the aquatic side of the trench and not on the side penetrated into the zone
land? How to explain that this supposed subduction occurs in an arc?
If the plates are supposedly being generated at the ridges
mid-ocean trenches that are supposedly rising, and the oceanic trenches
are supposedly generated by supposed penetrations of a plate
below another, how is it possible that there are intersections of pits with
dorsal? How is it possible that material is rising and falling at the same
weather? What forces break plates supposedly between 50 and 200 km in diameter?
thickness so they are separated? What forces make one
penetrate under another? What forces make it possible to overcome the enormous
pressures that would be generated in opposition to the supposed plate that
penetrate? If one plate is penetrating under another and there is a strong
friction when doing it, how to explain that the layers of sedimentation in the
pits are not disturbed? If ocean trenches are produced by
plate subduction, a process that would increase the mass below the
upper plate, how to explain the mass deficiencies below the
pits?

The story has several logical problems.

But what about all the evidence to the contrary and the lack of it?
favour? And what about all the failed logic of assumptions
mechanisms? Any. Nothing happens. The topic is ignored. The evidence and
failed logic is as if they did not exist.

### Dorsals.

In the planet's oceans, a formation is observed on the ground
known as mid-oceanic or mid-oceanic ridges. In

the entire planet similar to how seams surround a

How do tectonic plates form?

What we DO observe is that in various parts of the formation there is
cracks in perpendicular directions. These cracks indicate
stress fracture, separation fracture, separation fracture, in two
perpendicular directions. Some perpendicular to the line of the
dorsal and others parallel to the line of the dorsal. The parallels to
dorsal NEVER cross the perpendiculars. This observation is
completely contrary to the way in which cells are believed to form.

The evidence observed, these cracks, indicate that the ridges are
formed by tension fractures, NOT compression fractures, much less in TWO
perpendicular directions.

famous Internet encyclopedias. But YES it can be seen with the naked eye
on any ocean relief map.

Below India, east of Africa, on an ocean relief map,
a characteristic of the planetary ridge is observed: There is a
gigantic "ye" inverted, forming a meeting in the form of "te"
capital letter. If the dorsal is supposedly generating the formation of
tectonic plates, why don't we see accumulation of ocean floor,
way of mountain formations by compression, in the areas of the "te"
where would there be formation from two perpendicular directions? Other

### Hydroplates.

The alternative to the whole story of tectonic plates and their millions
of years is of course another story in which the
imagination because we cannot know the past with certainty. No one
you can travel to the past and confirm that it happened.

#### Another story.

In this story it must be recognized that the evidence and logic indicate
that there has to be a Creator.

This tale squares better with logic, with the evidence, and with the
testimony of the 6th chapter of the book of genesis about an event that
marked the history of humanity: a planetary flood.

Just look at a photo of the planet from space and see that
seems flooded with water to recognize that, just there, this story already
it squares better with logic, evidence, and the bible.

But it's still just another story. There is no technical creativity. Do not
it is something that the human being can reconstruct.

The following presentation is based on the theory of hydroplates or
“hydroplate theory” in English, initially proposed by Walt Brown in
1980 and last revised in 2019. Dr Brown may be called
doctor because he has a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT. His presentation
complete is in a book on the Internet called “[In

which can be downloaded for free or physically purchased at

Your host, that is, me, Jose Luis Quiroga, does not share the theory of
hydroplates in their entirety, not even in all the foundation
biblical But, in everything related to planetary geology, it seems to him
which is simply the most logical and coherent explanation, with all the
evidence, including the bible, that exists so far for what
we see today on the planet.

#### Terms.

The hydroplate theory starts from only 2 initial conditions for
explain more than 15 geological and planetary features that are
observe today, and that, in the light, pardon the darkness, of the
most popular explanations seem contradictory.

The two initial conditions are:

1. Groundwater.
2. Global granite shell

This planet had a global shell of granite that covered it
completely and had, under the shell, water stored in
underground chambers. There were no great oceans or great mountains. The
planet did not seem awash in water. The surface water was
a few hundred meters deep and the highest parts of the
mainland were also a few hundred meters. the shell of
granite was a few tens of kilometers thick. The height of the
underground chambers that contained the water between the granite shell
and the center of the planet was only a couple of kilometers.

#### The process.

That great shell of granite that covered the entire planet and that had
under super-critical water increasing in pressure every time the earth
rotated on its axis, it broke and tore, due to the pressure of that water
super-critical, just above the formation that today we call dorsal
oceanic and that divides the planet into two large parts as do the
seams of a baseball. All the continents we see today
day are the torn and shrunken pieces of what that shell was
of granite. As this shell burst and tore, it contracted,
shifted and shrunk slightly, releasing all the water inside it,
and since it was lubricated by the water that was escaping from its interior,
moved in the direction of contraction. The internal instability in
the planet generated by that tear slightly bulged the planet in the
Atlantic and submerged it slightly in the Pacific. the wrinkles on the
granite shell changed the surface mass distribution
of the planet and this, by conservation of angular momentum, caused a
latitude rotation on the planet and what was near the equator of the
planet is now the north pole. The end result of this process is
what we see today. The breaking phase lasted for hours, then the
flooding lasted for months, then the displacement phase lasted days and
finally the recovery phase is not over yet.

#### In two.

The mid-ocean ridge splits the planet in two.

1. A part includes half of what we now know as polo
    North, all the current Americas, all the current South Pole and all
    the southern part of the Indian Ocean to the tip of the inverted "y" of
    the ridge that is below present-day India.
2. The other part includes the rest: Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia,
    almost all of the Pacific Ocean and the northern part of the Indian Ocean.

To the part of the granite shell that now contains the Americas
will be called from now on the Atlantic hydroplate and the
another part of the granite shell, the largest in area, was
It will be called the Pacific hydroplate.

The Pacific hydroplate covered almost 3 quarters of the planet
while the Atlantic hydroplate only 1 quarter of the
planet. The two large hydroplates into which the shell was divided
of granite that covered the planet were lubricated by water
underground. Hence the name of the theory. hydroplate theory.

#### A comparison.

Imagine a ball the size of an apple with a waterproof fabric
that covers it. The fabric is the same thickness as the shell of the
apple, and between the ball and the cloth there is a lubricant. The ball is the
planet, the fabric is the shell of granite, and the lubricant is the water
muddy in super-critical state.

When the fabric covering the ball is torn along a line with the same
shape of the mid-ocean ridge, the fabric slides over the surface of
the ball letting the lubricant escape and contracts forming what
now we call continents.

At the same time that this is happening, the ball deforms
slightly in a tenth of the thickness of the fabric. On one side of
the ball bulges into a tenth of the thickness of the fabric and by the
opposite side sinks to a similar thickness. The collapses would be
pacific trenches.

When the fabric shrinks and shifts, the fabric will wrinkle slightly on
some parts of its surface, not more than one-tenth of the thickness
of the cloth. The wrinkles would be the mountains.

The escaping lubricant ends up largely on the fabric that covers it.
covered. That water would be the oceans. At first glance it only seems that the
fabric tore and shrank and that the liquid escaped and covered
good part of the ball.

The wrinkles, that is to say the mountains, and the depressions, that is to say the
pits, are difficult to perceive with the naked eye in the ball of the size
of an apple because they only have a maximum height of one tenth of the
thickness of the fabric that covered the ball and that would be the thickness of the
apple peel

This comparison only gives us an idea of ​​what happened to the fabric and
with the lubricant, that is to say with the granite shell and with the water
super-critical that was in the underground chambers, the two
initial conditions of the hydroplate theory.

Let's see a little more in detail how the whole process is.

#### Breakout Phase.

##### Water.

For a few hundred years, the water that was in chambers
underground beneath the granite shell that completely covered
the planet was heating up and increasing pressure due to the
daily rotation of the planet and the presence of the moon until reaching the
state known as super-fluid or super-critical. state in which the
matter is neither gas nor liquid but super-fluid, also called
supercritical.

The increase in pressure and temperature of the super-critical water contained in
the underground chambers made the ceiling of granite and the floor of
silicates from the chambers will begin to dissolve in the water
super critical. A couple of kilometers from the granite shell was
dissolved in a few hundred years by super-critical water and this
I weaken the granite shell.

The pressure reached such a point that a crack opened on the surface of
the granite shell that grew horizontally and vertically, i.e.
in deep. First it ended up traveling horizontally around the planet
in a matter of a few hours, just above what is now
seen as the mid-ocean ridge. The crack in the granite shell
opened like stretched fabric that begins to tear.

When the crack reached the depth of the underground chambers, the
super-critical water stored under the shell began to leak out
fired by said crack at super-sonic speeds releasing a
stored energy greater than ten billion hydrogen bombs and
reaching heights of tens of kilometers in the atmosphere. The majority
of that water is what we now observe in the oceans.

Water in a superfluid state released at supersonic speeds
underwent a chain reaction by the energy stored on the surface
of the microscopic droplets and in the ions of the super-fluid. The heat
released was almost entirely used in the union of the ions and
almost instantaneously on the vaporization of existing droplets or
resulting from the union of ions producing an incremental expansion
in vapor form at supersonic speeds as the
super-fluid was released.

The super-fluid jet and its vertically directed expansion that
should have observed can be imagined by observing the jets of steam
released on Saturn's moon Enceladus and on Jupiter's moon Europa.
Since the energy released in this cataclysm was much greater than the
that is released on these moons, the jet would have been along the entire
the crack, at much higher heights and speeds, much more focused, and
without so much dispersion of the super-fluid that escapes through the crack,
comparing with what is observed in these moons.

In the same way that the tip of a metal cutting torch focuses
the gas released in a directed jet of gas, the jet of water
super-critical released was focused vertically into space
exterior by the crack in the granite shell that formed just
above what is now known as the mid-ocean ridge.

The ridge was the floor of the underground chamber below the crack and
it simply marks the point where the granite shell gave way
pressure and the crack opened. At this time there was still no
raised said floor and the number still did not exist.

##### Objects.

A good part of the material that was shot vertically with the
super-critical water escaped into outer space and because they had
approximately the same vector velocity, that is, its velocity
was roughly the same in both magnitude and direction, that
material was gathered by the simple action of gravity in many of
the objects that today we call asteroids, meteorites, comets and objects
trans-neptunians.

#### Flood Phase.

Another part of the super-critical water that shot out did not come out of the
atmosphere but produced rains as abundant as the planet does not
had had until then and never had since. part of that water
super-critical froze in the lower temperatures of the lower layers.
high in the atmosphere and produced abundant hail showers.

##### Hail.

All the material that had been diluted in the ceiling of the chambers
groundwater was expelled along with the super-critical water and fell on
the planet in the form of muddy rain or icy muddy hail.

Where hailstorms occurred, an effect was produced that today
we identify with ice ages. Actually it was just one and the effects
have been preserved in some parts due to the rotation of latitude that
the planet suffered. All evidence of frozen plants and animals
near the north pole indicates that they were from the tropics and that they were
frozen very quickly. This evidence is consistent with what
would happen if, a few months after being buried under hail, the
planet underwent a rotation of latitude that puts a tropical zone in
the North Pole.

##### Downloads.

The high pressures, with which the super critical water was shot out
through the crack, they were widening, eroding, wearing away, the crack,
the opening, through which the water escaped, to such an extent that it lost
pressure and the rains stopped. But the water level on the planet
I kept going up because muddy water kept escaping from the chambers
underground that were under the granite shell.

As the super-critical water escape opening widened
a similar effect was produced on the granite shell, only
much slower, to what happens with the tongue when saying
“BRRRRRRRRR”: the tongue vibrates or flaps. This flutter effect,
undulation, of vertical vibration, made the jet of water that came out
shot through what was just a crack, already turned into an opening,
will also press.

This undulation in the Atlantic and Pacific hydroplates produced
a piezo-electric effect inside the hydroplates that
They generated large discharges of energy. Downloads similar to that
happen when we see lightning fall from the sky. These rays or discharges of
electrical energy occurred between the surface and the bottom of the
gigantic granite hydroplates. The z-pinch effect that happened in
these internal rays of what we now call continental crust, is
say the original granite shell, produced a fission effect
nuclear in the atoms used in the plasmatic zone of each ray, and this
produced heavy elements that began to decay into the elements
radioactive that we observe today mainly in said crust
continental.

##### Strata.

The muddy water sat on top of the granite shell by the
action of slow ripples about 60 meters high, both from the water
above these, as of the very shell of granite on which
they were sitting The liquefaction of these sediments, together with
this undulation, they were separating the sediments in different layers with
repetitive patterns. These layers were not necessarily in order of
size, shape, and density because not all sediments fell at the same
weather.

The torrential rains lasted 40 days and the water continued to pour out of
underground chambers for another 110 days. During all this time it
these layers were produced. These layers of sediment that came
of the roof of the underground chambers that stored water
super-critical, i.e. the bottom of the granite shell, is
what we now know as geological strata.

The water transported the material of the walls of the chambers
groundwater that was diluted in said water for hundreds of years before
that the crack was formed through which the water escaped. This water, with
said materials diluted in it, moved, from under the
granite shell, to above the shell, as said water
was escaping from the underground chambers through the crack
converted into an opening. By the process known as liquefaction,
these materials together with the biological remains of what died
on the surface, they settled down, forming what is now
known as geological strata.

Not all geological strata were formed at this time, but the
Most of the non-biological material comes from the ceiling of these chambers.
underground. All that we call sedimentary rock.

#### Displacement Phase.

##### Dorsal.

When the rains stopped, the water continued to flow for several months and
because the crack widened so much that the water pressure
decreased, the downward pressure on the floor of the chambers
groundwater under the crack also decreased. This
decrease in pressure on the floor of the underground chambers made
for the floor to rise. It was first raised parallel to the crack
in the granite shell. Then, as the crack in the
granite was widening, the floor under the crack was
lifting in a direction perpendicular to the crack in the granite. East
lifting produced cracks in the floor perpendicular to the lines
of the lifts. First cracks perpendicular to the crack and
then cracks parallel to the crack in the granite. This is the reason
for which the cracks in the mid-ocean ridge, that which was the floor of
underground chambers, have the characteristic that those that are
parallel to the dorsal never cross the perpendicular ones. The
perpendicular to the dorsal were formed first and then those parallel to
the mid-ocean ridge. This process generated what we now know as the
oceanic ridge.

##### Magnetic.

The cracks parallel to the mid-ocean ridge make the temperature
subterranean of the ridge below said cracks is smaller than in the
areas where there is no crack. Since the magnetic capacity of
chemical elements depends on the temperature, the intensity of the
magnetism is greater where the temperature is lower. That's why the
magnetism is greatest just above where the cracks are.

This curve of intensity of magnetism that corresponds perfectly
with the underground temperature is the one that has been misunderstood in the
popular tale of saying that in the past there were polarity reversals
at the magnetic poles of the planet. They never happened. Just have to
correctly interpret the evidence.

##### Separated.

Like the hydroplates the granite shell split into
were lubricated by groundwater, and due to the strong flow of
super-critical water, the two gigantic hydroplates were at the
drift, kept afloat by the pressure of the water trying to get out
only by the rupture zone, just above the current mid-ocean ridge.

This movement of the gigantic hydroplates lasted until the pressure
of the water that came out of the underground chambers diminished enough
so that the ceiling of the chambers began to rub against the floor of the
cameras. This friction generated large amounts of magma and the
movement of the hydroplates began to stop.

#### Recovery Phase.

##### Magma.

The imbalance in the pressures in the terrestrial mantle product of the
uplifts in the mid-ocean ridge and the displacement of the
hydroplates caused internally in the planet's mantle to generate
small vertical cuts that were rubbed as a result of that
vertical displacement of the surface and of the regions below it
they.

These vertical cuts increased in quantity to the sides and to the
inside the planet as the ridge formed, it went
lifting, and as the area around the dorsal also went
lifting up. That friction produced heat and that heat made the material
melted into magma in these vertical micro-cuts. This produced a
cycle that accelerated the process. The magma lubricated the micro cuts, these
grew, this facilitated more vertical movement, more friction, more
heat, more magma, more lubrication. In this way they generated
gigantic columns of terrestrial mantle, below these zones,
separated by thin cracks lubricated with magma. These columns go
almost from what were the underground chambers to the liquid zone
of the planet's core.

##### Earthquakes.

The magma is much more compressible than the mantle and below the
crossing depth, where the pressure is high enough, that
is about 350 kilometers, the magma was compressed, became denser and
sank toward the core of the planet.

Above the crossing depth the magma expanded and came out to the
area.

This type of movement of the magma is the cause of what even today
we observe and call seismic movements.

Currently in the area near the crossing depth there is almost no
magma movements. This is the reason why they are hardly perceived
seismic movements whose epicenter is close to the depth of the
350 kilometers. In this zone there are almost no magma displacements. The
The vast majority of magma displacements occur near the surface.
and a minority occur near the liquid zone of the planetary core.

The increase in compressed mass of magma in the planet's core
continues today and this increase has caused the planet to be
losing volume. Similar to what is observed when a fruit loses
dry volume.

The flow of magma towards the center of the planet continues today and is the
cause of the seismic movements of the planet.

##### Countryside.

The rise of compressed magma in the liquid zone of the planet's core
caused the magnetic material in the liquid crystals to be
displaced were reoriented with the magnetic field of the planet and this is
the reason why the magnetic field of this planet is much stronger
larger than that of the rest of the solid planets in the solar system.

This alignment with the pre-existing field of magnetic elements
that moved towards the nucleus increased said magnetic field.

The crystallization of these magnetic elements, mainly iron and
nickel, generated a solid center on the planet. The solid zone of the core
planetary.

##### Bulging and Sinking.

The movement of the magma fed back: more vertical movement, more
friction, more heat, more magma, more lubrication and more movement
vertical.

The internal imbalance of the planet increased. A part of the planet
bulge and the opposite part sank.

The part that bulged is what we now know as the Atlantic Ocean and
the part that sank is the area that is inside what we now know
like the pacific ocean ring of fire. The magma that came out
surface formed the more than 40 thousand oceanic volcanoes that can be seen in
the Pacific.

This analysis allows to make one of the most important predictions of
hydroplate theory that has not been verified: In the area within
the gigantic "u" formed by the ring of fire, inside that
"u", under the floor of that area that is all sunk in the ocean
Pacific, below the floor of the layer of volcanic formations that are
in that area, and bordering the entire interior of that "u" that forms the
ring of fire, THERE SHOULD BE two large submerged pieces of the
GRANITE hydroplates that separated just above the ridge of the
peaceful.

##### Pits.

When the planet sank, a part of the gigantic hydroplate of the
Pacific also sank, sank with the surface of the planet, in
the western part of the gigantic "u" of the Pacific Ocean that today
known as "the ring of fire", bordering the coasts of Asia and
Oceania.

And, when the planet sank, a part of the gigantic hydroplate of the
Atlantic sank, sank with the surface of the planet, in the part
east of said "ring of fire", bordering the coasts of the
Americas.

These sinking is what we observe as oceanic trenches in said
fire belt.

##### Moutains.

When the friction between the ceiling and the floor of the underground chambers
stopped the movement of the gigantic hydroplates, in some
parts the hydroplates rose, wrinkled, producing the
mountains we see today. By that time they were in a state of
liquefaction and behaved as a dense fluid.

##### Mismatch.

In some areas of the planet, where there were wrinkles in the hydroplates of
granite low enough to still be completely
covered with water, the sediments that were on the high points of
the wrinkles were re-ordered by the waves in the water not finding
support on the granite hydroplate.

Due to the difference in densities between layer and layer, the remains
biologics of plants and animals slid uphill where the
pressure was lower and they reorganized into new horizontal layers
above levels are now known as geological unconformities.

##### Hydrocarbons.

The biological material that was separated in the middle of these layers
upper layers of sedimentation was compressed by the wrinkling of the
hydroplates and later by the weight of the upper layers and
I reach high temperatures. Depending on the amount of water, the
pressure reached and the temperature reached formed the deposits of
coal, oil and gas that we see today.

The gigantic hydrocarbon deposits that cannot be explained if
formed over millions of years, because it would be impossible
maintain the necessary conditions in such large blocks for so long
time, they find a completely feasible explanation under a
process that lasted only a few months and that can be reproduced today,
in its chemical aspect, in the laboratory.

##### Cannons.

The formation of mountains caused part of the water that was above
the hydroplates will be trapped in some parts thus forming
gigantic lakes above the hydroplates. seismic movements
produced by the movement of magma on the planet both towards the
surface and towards the core of the planet caused some lakes
will overflow slightly producing a chain effect of that
overflow in which the flow of water increases the size of the point of
overflow until producing a gigantic outlet through which the water of the lake
It comes out until it's almost empty.

This process was what generated, in a few weeks, great canyons
like the one found in Colorado.

The water that came out of these lakes sought the path of least resistance
and as it flowed it took with it some of the land around it
and scratched, carved, in the ground the kind of patterns that are observed
in the canyons.

##### Plateaus.

The friction between the ceiling and the floor of the underground chambers, almost
without water, it not only stopped the movement of hydroplates and crumpled them
forming today's mountains, but generated large amounts of
magma where the ceiling and floor of the chambers touched.

When the weight of the granite hydroplates where there was more mass, it is
say in the mountainous areas, began to sink them, the magma moved
to the underground parts of the chambers where there was less weight above,
less pressure, that is to say where there were no mountains above.

As magma accumulates under these flat areas, the pressure that the
Upward magma vertically fractured the granite hydroplate and the
vertical fracture crack filled with magma allowing the
Magma will escape from the chambers to the surface of the hydroplates.

This magma lubrication allowed hydroplate blocks to rise
as rises in piston. The pressure of the magma that was below and that
escaped along its perimeter, lubricating the rise of these blocks of
hydroplate generated the plateaus that are observed near some
large and heavy mountainous areas.

##### Butte.

The same uplift that generated the plateaus is also part of what
that generated the overflow of lakes that had formed when the water
was surrounded by mountains and that generated canyons such as the
Colorado in Arizona. And in cases where later the water that is
overflowed from a lake water flowed around the solidified magma in
volcanic rock formed the so-called Butte. mountain formations of
plateau type having solid magma or rock on top
volcanic as Red Butte in the United States.

##### Latitude rotation.

After the formation of the mountains, that wrinkling of the
hydroplates, and due to conservation of angular momentum, the zones
of high latitudes in which great mountains were formed began to
move to more southern latitudes and the planet suffered a
latitude rotation. Today's north pole was once in the zone
tropical. Evidence for this rotation of latitude is found in the
angular variation of polarization in the magnetic material that left
solidifying into magma that cooled as the planet rotated
thus leaving a record of said rotation.

##### Meridian 90.

The oceanic formation known as "the ridge of the meridian 90 East",
which is located just below the area with the highest mountains in the
planet, is another evidence that is observed today and that is explained
by the rotation of latitude suffered by the planet. Since the
planet is not perfectly round but is more bulky in the
equator, as the planet rotated in latitude, the area that reached
to the equator was with the tension generated by the daily turn of the
planet, and in the same way that a round rubber bursts for a single
point, the surface of the planet was always tearing by the same
point and as the magma generated in the crack was coming out it was
solidifying on the surface thus generating said mountainous formation
in what is now the indigo ocean. That's the reason why it's almost
a straight line. It simply indicates the direction in which the planet rotated.
And the length of the formation tells us how much the planet rotated, the angle
that rotated the planet.

##### Follow.

The recovery phase continues today. We still have growth in
the nucleus product of displacement of magma towards said nucleus. This
produces some of the seismic movements that we observe today. The
Other earthquakes are the product of displacement of magma towards the
surface also producing the volcanic activity that we observe today
day. The slight bulge in the Atlantic and slight sinking of the
peaceful in the central zone of the ring of fire continues today and for
that the small displacement observed in the continental crusts
is directed towards that area of ​​the Pacific. And we still watch
planetary flood effects on water and frozen poles
of the planet.

#### Differences.

Your host, that is me, Jose Luis Quiroga, has some differences
with the presentation of the hydroplate theory or "hydroplate theory"
what Walt Brown does in his book “In the Beginning” and with Brian
Nickel, a contributor to the Center for Scientific Creation,
organization that maintains creationscience.com, in its videos of
Internet.

One big difference is in what Genesis 1 and 2 include as part of
THIS creation. This should be obvious to anyone who has not been
skipped the section of this video dedicated to creation, and to read the
Walt Brown's In the Beginning book.

Fortunately, the hydroplate theory has more to do with what
happened during the planetary flood in Noah's time than with what
happened during creation.

The biggest difference is in the biblical substantiation of the
initial conditions of the hydroplate theory.

It is completely incoherent to think that the word H8064 [^692] stops
mean heavens, shamaim, that in which according to Genesis 1 the birds
fly, in a single verse of the bible: the one that says that
“God called the expanse Heavens: and it was evening and
tomorrow the second day” [^693].

Trying to give various meanings to the word H8064 [^694], the shamaim,
the heavens, in the first chapter of the bible, to then choose the
I like best to fit the two main assumptions of
my story, however logical and consistent with current evidence, is
theologically untenable.

The Bible says that: "And God made the expansion, and separated
the waters that were BELOW the expanse, from the waters that were
ABOUT the expansion: and it was like that” [^695]. And then "called
God to the expanse HEAVENS” [^696]. The same word heavens, the word
H8064 [^697], plural, shamayim, is used during all of the first two
chapters consistently to refer to that place where they are observed
the sun, the moon and the stars, that place where the birds fly.

But no, only when God decided to call the expansion "heavens", which
this theory wants to understand how the granite shell is that it does not
means what it always means because obviously the heavens don't
they may be a shell of granite.

It is also very clear in saying that God said: "Gather the
waters that are UNDER the heavens in one place, and the DRY be discovered:
and it was so” [^698]. That dry is the shell of granite. that dry came out
of the waters that were UNDER the expanse. That dry was UNDER
of the expansion. That dry, which is the shell of granite, is UNDER
from the heaven. That dry is NOT the heavens.

It is perfectly possible that it is precisely this verse that gives
support to the two initial conditions of the theory of
hydroplates. He says: “Gather together the waters that are UNDER
of heaven in one place, and discover the dry: and it was so” [^699]. To the
uncover the dry, in the waters that were UNDER the heavens,
said waters that were gathered in ONE place, as you like
emphasize the book, they also formed the seas, plural, some in the
underground chambers, others on the surface.

And the fact that the proponents of the hydroplate theory do not seem
there may be the famous canopy, that water that the bible tells us that
was ABOVE the heavens, that because the pressure, that because the
temperature, that because the greenhouse effect, that because... to me
sounds like the same kind of apologies many so-called scientists have
with this story in particular, with the theory of hydroplates: how much
heat, that much cold, that the transfer of heat, that a lot of energy.

If Jesus Christ really was resurrected, we may not understand all the
details of why there were waters above the heavens, why the
Bible is completely true. But that doesn't mean it can't be
as the bible affirms, or that I start to adapt it so that it fits with
my prejudices.

To invent tales of a past that fit the description
biblical, with what is observed today, and that it is sufficiently
coherent enough to call it scientific, according to the most
popular, NOT the one in this video, just lack imagination.

Also to explain all the mass that exists in asteroids, meteorites,
comets and trans-Neptunian objects that supposedly came out of this
planet, according to this story, it is much easier with that little water that we
the bible says it was there, instead of being six times the width
of the granite shell so that the data reported by the pagan
NASA square with my theory.

Here we are not talking about technical creativity, the one that in this video
it is the only one that is accepted to validate a scientific theory. Here
we are simply talking about imagination. This is just another story
about the past, that which we cannot know.

In this story only lack imagination. Not as much as needed
tectonic plate theory, but imagination after all.

### The couple.

The Bible tells us that all human beings are descended from one
single couple Adam and Eve.

Many so-called Bible believers tend to read Genesis as if
it was poetry. Or as if they were the parables of Jesus Christ. But
Hebrew used in Genesis tells us that it is a narrative
historical. That what Genesis narrates is exactly as it happened.

Many people find it hard to believe that ALL of humanity is
offspring of a single parent. The reason is the story with which
They dirty our brains since we were little: the story of evolution.

A first observation is that mathematically it is much more probable that
population growth, consistent with today's observations,
have a recent beginning, than one from hundreds of thousands of years ago.

On the other hand, genetics, the one that is not supported by
technical creativity, that which has no idea how to create a lung, or
a kidney, from a drop of my blood, has recently begun
to talk about a genetic Adam and a genetic Eve.

Genetic Adam is identified with a single "Y" chromosome common to all
humanity and the genetic Eve with a single mitochondria common to all
humanity.

However, this kind of conclusions from genetics, which is a field
of study plagued by the story of evolution, is like concluding that
because two programs have common functions, or because two machines
have equal parts, then said programs and said machines
They must have a common origin.

We can't even make our own show, or our own
biological machines, or else make me my liver from my drop of
blood, and we pretend to be able to explain, through what we do not understand,
how was the process at the genetic level with our ancestors, and without believing
in the existence of a creator. Absurd, right? But that's how we are.

#### Reproduction.

A model that we see on a day-to-day basis that supports the possibility that
all mankind is descended from a single couple just a few
few thousand years is the reproduction of biological systems.

The 37 million million, or 37 teras, of cells in a human body
they formed in just 40 weeks of gestation. All 37 teras of
cells came from just ONE cell: the fertilized egg.

The exponential growth that occurs when each cell divides by
mitosis in two others is a process easily comparable to a process
similar in a population in which each pair has as offspring
to two other couples.

And just as complete systems can come out of a single cell
completely different as the respiratory, the digestive, the
nervous, circulatory, with specialized elements to carry out
consistently a function, similarly, in a population that
part of a single human couple can be given all the variety that
we observe today in the human population.

#### No cheating.

However, by means of arguments that presume to understand
genetic the process of human reproduction is intended to deny this
possibility. First BUILD my lung, and only my LUNG, from
of my drop of blood, to believe that he really understands at the level
GENETIC that happens during the process of human reproduction.

Because if they want me to believe that they understand how the
program, it is not enough for me to put it to execute and then MOCHEN the
Outcome.

One thing is to click on the icon and another thing to do the program of what
What does the icon do?

When we make CLONCITOS, either in the way that our
Creator, man with woman, or other less pleasant, the only thing that
we are doing is 'clicking' the icon without having any idea how it works
the program.

To believe them that they understand human reproduction at the genetic level,
first make me my lung from a drop of my blood. But without
trap, JUST my lung.

### Dinosaurs.

One of the main facts that must be taken into account whenever
think about dinosaurs is that: every time a test has been carried out
of Carbon 14 in dinosaur fossils has been found to have
Carbon 14. This means that, according to the assumptions of the dating
radiometric, those dinosaur fossils can NOT have more than 60 thousand
years.

No person who believes the tale of evolution likes this
done. Because the only alternative to the existence of the Creator of the sky
and from the earth is that story of evolution. And if we don't want
recognize the existence of the Creator, we decide to believe the falsehoods that
we were taught in school. The tale of the toad.

However, there is clear evidence that the dinosaurs became extinct.
recently, if they haven't gone extinct yet. and there is clear
evidence that man always lived with these animals, if
does not continue living with the few that remain.

Nowadays, thanks to the Internet, it is easy to verify that:

1. Different cultures around the planet in different periods
    Historical figures have drawn, sculpted and elaborated objects in different
    animal materials whose shape matches what we now call
    dinosaurs.
2. Historical records in different time periods have narrated
    events in which animals are described that coincide with what
    now we call dinosaurs.
3. In different parts of the world there are fossilized traces of beings
    humans next to those of animals that coincide with what is now
    we call dinosaurs.
4. The vast majority of dinosaur fossils are found in
    groups of animals that indicate rapid and simultaneous death.
5. Bones of these animals have been found that are preserved and
    WITHOUT fossilizing.
6. Soft tissue has been found in some of these animals.
7. Residues of blood cells from these animals have been found.
8. Residues of blood vessels from these animals have been found.
9. Connective tissue has been found from these animals.
10. It has been found in the stomach of these animals residues of
    flowers, tree leaves, ferns, shrubs, algae and
    vegetation in general.
11. There are recent testimonies, in different parts of the planet, that
    claim to have seen animals that match what we now call
    dinosaurs.
12. Until the 19th century the word “dragon” was found in some
    dictionaries as a word that refers to a class of animals
    like the ones we now call dinosaurs. some dictionaries
    They even note that these animals are in danger of
    extinction.

But what happens when this evidence is found? Nothing, nothing happens.
It is simply ignored, denied or misrepresented because it is not consistent
with the story of the millions of years that they taught us in school,
It is not consistent with the story of the toad.

There are several reptilian animals that have the appearance of what is now
we call dinosaurs. In fact the word "dinosaur" means
"terrible lizard" Several of these animals never stop growing.

Now most don't live long but it's quite possible they lived
hundreds of years before the planetary flood.

There are fossils of other animals, such as winged insects, which due to their size
they couldn't fly in today's atmosphere. These fossils suggest that
before the radioactive fallout of the planetary flood,
these animals grew much more. Now imagine an 800 iguana
years that never stopped growing. That would be a terrible iguana.

#### Biblical.

Additionally, the Bible describes some animals that resemble
much like what we now know as dinosaurs.

In Job 40 it says that: “Behold the Behemoth, my creation, just like you. The
eat grass like cattle. Take into account the power he has in his body
and the strength you have in your stomach muscles. he wags his tail
like a CEDAR. His leg muscles form knots. his bones are
like BRONZE pipes; its extremities, like COLUMNS OF IRON. is the
MAXIMUM creature of God; only he who did it can bring his sword closer to
the. In truth, the mountains offer him his food, where everyone plays
the wild animals. He sleeps under the lotus plants and
hides among the reeds of the swamp. Lotus plants cover it with
his shadow; the willows of the ravine surround it. If the river overflows and
hit him violently, he will not be alarmed. He is not afraid though
Jordan reaches his mouth. Can anyone capture it before his eyes?
Can someone put ties through their nose?” [^700].

By that description, the Behemoth closely resembles what we now call
sauropods.

In Job 41 it says, “I will tell you about legs, strength and good
Leviathan form. Who is capable of PUNCHING their skin? Who can
PENETRATE his double breastplate? Who is able to open his jaws
powerful? The appearance of her teeth instills terror. Her back is like
a row of shields, strongly united, sealed; so together the one
to the other, that not even air can pass between them. They are so
pressed together that they cannot be separated. When he sneezes, he spits
light; her eyes are like rays of dawn. He expels FIRE through his mouth; you
They jump like SPARKS. He blows smoke through his nose; like when smoke comes out of
a boiling pot. He blows his breath and makes the coal burn. come out
flames from his mouth. He has a very strong neck; those who find it
they are filled with DREAD. It has strongly attached skin folds;
their flesh is inseparable. His heart is hard as a rock, as hard as
Millstone. When Leviathan rises, even the gods
frighten; when he snorts, they shoot out in disarray. The SWORD does not
manages to penetrate it; NEITHER THE SPEAR, the dart or the javelin. The iron
it is to him like STRAW; the BRONZE, like OLD WOOD. The arrows don't
drive away; feel the rocks as if it were grass. When they hit a
palazo, it's like tickling him. She bursts out laughing at the sight of the javelin.
Its side is as if it had sharp potsherds; Creeping does
GROOVES in the mud. Makes water stir like in a pot
boiling; makes the sea bubble like a pot when mixed
ointments. It leaves behind a brilliant wake; as if a hair
White came out of the abyss. She has no equal on earth. He is the only one
created animal that DOES NOT KNOW what FEAR is. Leviathan looks with
I despise the most proud. He is the KING of ANIMALS” [^701].

By that description, the leviathan could easily be some kind of the
which we now call tyrannosaurs.

The Bible also contains evidence that these animals always
They lived with humans.

### Taxonomy.

The classification of animals is currently plagued by the story
of evolution, of the tale of the toad. The classification criteria are
those of a genetic evolution that NEVER happened.

#### 18th century.

At the beginning of the 18th century, the classification was more evident.
Literally. The classification of the father of modern taxonomy was
simple and according to the evidence observable with the naked eye.

He classified more than 40 thousand animals in only 6 large groups that translated
from Latin, because he liked Latin, they would be something like:

1. quadrupeds,
2. birds,
3. amphibians,
4. fish,
5. insects and
6. worms.

Of course it is just a name because among the quadrupeds was the
man and ape.

In their first versions, the quadrupeds had 33 kinds of animals,
birds had 47 classes, amphibians 4 classes, fish 41 classes,
insects 47 classes and worms 19 classes.

He called these kinds of animals “genera” or genus in Spanish. With
Over time, the classification acquired more levels, but in its first
versions did not exist neither the families nor those that later called classes
as such.

In these first classifications of animals by "genera" can be
distinguish names such as “equus”, “elephas”, “tigris”, “canis”, “felis”,
“camelus”, “simian”, “turkey”, “hen”, “falco”, which logically
correspond to names such as "equine", "elephant", "tiger", "canine",
“feline”, “camel”, “ape”, “turkey”, “hen”, “falco”.

Each one would be a class or type of animal that resembles each other.
Yes. Thus, among the "equus" we find the zebra and the horse. It was one
logical classification, simple. It was not biblical but it was evident.

#### Biblical.

In the bible, the classification of animals is even simpler,
more evident and obviously among the animals there is not the human being but
if there are the dragons, that is to say the dinosaurs, those that were already
rare in the 18th century.

A first classification is meat. And the meat in the bible has
BLOOD. And the blood in the bible is RED. There is no blood in the bible
blue, not yellow, not green, not purple, there is only red blood. Thus, one
The first classification of animals is given by those that have
Red blood.

A second classification is whether they live in water, on land, or fly.
Amphibians are among those that live in water.

Those who comply with living on earth and having meat, the bible
divided into two groups: those that crawl and those that don't.

It is a classification that roughly corresponds to the one
they taught one at school. Two large groups: vertebrates in
invertebrates. In other words, meat and not meat, because almost all of the
vertebrates are red blooded, so the comparison is approximate.

Vertebrates are divided into fish, amphibians, mammals, reptiles and
birds. That is water, land and fly. Where are the land
divided into mammals and reptiles. And the water ones would be the fish and
amphibians because the bible does not differentiate them.

It is a simple, logical and obvious classification. Much more than those of
21st century.

#### Few.

And why all this explanation?

Well, because if we take into account the classification by "genera" of the father
of modern taxonomy, at the beginning of the 18th century, that is to say very
recently, we only have a little more than 80 kinds or types of animals
to put in the boat built by Noah and his relatives. These would be
the same ones that Adam named in a morning because YHWH did not put him to
name insects, or aquatic animals, or other supposed animals,
according to some EXA-modern classifications, of the 21st century, that neither
They are not even seen with the naked eye, like viruses or BACTERIA.

#### Adaptation.

The diversification of the animals that came out of Noah's ark, in what
now called species, which is nothing more than the adaptation of
these animals to different environmental conditions, occurred after
the great planetary flood.

All the canines that we classify as different species are
simply the adaptation to a specific environment of the pair of
canines that came out of the boat that Noah and his relatives built.

But from the canines only little canines come out and it has NEVER been seen that from a
canine comes out a FELINITO or a EQUINITO. The same goes for all
“elephas”, “tigris”, “equus”, “felis”, “camelus”, “simia”, “pavo”,
“chicken”, “falco” from the father of MODERN taxonomy.

Among the evidence supporting this claim is that:

1. There is the case of animals of the same gender but of different
    species, which supposedly cannot be crossed, if they coexist
    enough time under the same conditions, they begin to be able to
    Cross.
2. There is the case of animals of the same genus and of different species and
    that cannot interbreed with each other, for which there is a third
    species of the same genus that can be crossed with the first two.

Thus, the total number of animals in Noah's ark is even less than what
has an average current zoo and that is maintained by 3 or 4 people
in charge of the animals.

### Noah's Ark.

The bible tells us that YHWH commands Noah to build an ark made
of specially treated wood and 300 cubits long by 50
cubits wide by 30 cubits high. It also tells us that said ark
ran aground in the mountains of Ararat after the flood water
planetarium began to go down.

#### 1948.

In the year 1948 a series of earthquakes and rains brought out what
now known as the Durupinar Archaeological Site at Uzengili
Turkey. It was discovered by a shepherd in the area and later in 1959
identified on an aerial photo by an experienced cartographer named
Durupinar and that is why he is now known by that name.

The reason Durupinar was struck by such a place is because
the way it is. From the air it looks like the deck of a ship. An
huge ship.

After blowing up part of what looked like a ship, the expedition
of which Durupinar was part, they came to the conclusion that what
it looked like a boat "it was a phenomenon of nature and it was not made
by the man”. Popular encyclopedias on the Internet stay with
this conclusion. Perhaps it seems to them that DYNAMITING a place, that the
government of Turkey now recognizes as archaeological, it is a way
efficient way to excavate a site of archaeological interest.

#### 2014.

Several people have continued to push the investigation of the place of
particular way. Without the help of any government and with their own money.

As recently as 2014 a team from New Zealand led by a
geophysicist named John Larsen obtained permission from Turkey to
scan the resistivity of the ground in the area.

The result is simply undeniable: underneath what seems like the
deck of a gigantic ship, there is material of the same resistivity
that has the shape of the hull of a ship that corresponds to said
deck. It is rationally impossible to think that it is not a ship.

#### The facts.

The facts of what has a ship structure are several:

1. It has the dimensions in royal Egyptian cubits given in the Bible:
    300 cubits by 50 cubits by 30 cubits.
2. It is in the ancient mountains of Ararat.
3. The translation of the local name of the mountain would be “the mountain of the
    judgment".
4. It is close to a town that the locals know as “the town of
    the 8”.
5. Near the spot there are stone anchors of the appropriate size for a
    that size pot.
6. It is almost 1800 meters above sea level in a place where there is no
    there is water nearby.
7. There are old maps that identified the place as the place of
    rest of the biblical ark.
8. The place was visited by pilgrims in ancient times.
9. The boat shape incorporates high math principles and
    advanced knowledge of hydrodynamics.
10. His story is consistent with the histories of Sumeria, Akkad,
    Babylon as well as the Torah, the Old Testament and the
    Korans.
11. Two additional scans carried out in 2019 with methodologies
    different, by a specialized company contracted by Andrew
    Jones of [noahsarkscans.com](https://www.noahsarkscans.com/),
    indicate that it is a ship.

Too many coincidences, of those that accumulate with exponential effect.
Actually there are more coincidences but they are not so easy to confirm.
Still, these are already too many coincidences. It's almost the same as
It happens with Internet searches. Statistically, and eye I emphasize
in the term "statistically" for reasons that will become apparent later.
forward, it is reasonably impossible to deny that it is the ship
described in the bible.

#### Logistics.

However, if we ignore the two fundamental principles of this
section of the video, it is rationally unattainable to believe the story of
Noah.

Even in the 21st century, assuming current technology availability,
and assuming abundant resources, it is difficult to imagine the possibility
of a company like that.

How to build a wooden ark of that size? How to choose and
transport the animals to the ark? How to accommodate them in the ark? What
keep all those animals, food, droppings, temperature, health,
etc. for a whole year, without anyone dying? How to explain that
in such extreme conditions a ship with such a load achieved its
objective? How to explain that the animals survived and then
repopulate the planet?

That there weren't so many animals, that wood can be treated with heat and
pressure together with oils of vegetable origin and make a more
stronger than steel, that they didn't have to go after the animals, that God
He explained everything to Noah, that Noah took more than fifty years to make the
ark, that the animals before the flood were vegetarians
including the T-rex, which was a flood and not a gigantic
storm, that the waves in the area of ​​the ark were passive, that they were
located in the area of ​​the planet least affected by the great rotation, which
before the flood biological systems including humans
they grew much larger and were much stronger than after the flood,
that they only carried baby animals and not adult animals, which before
the flood had never rained on the planet, that everything can come out of
a single couple in a similar way to how every sexual animal leaves
a single cell during its gestation, which before the flood
animals and people lived much longer because they did not get sick,
that not all the fossils that have been found are from that time because
a fossil can be formed in tens of years, that just after the
flood the continental crust had not sunk and therefore the
crustal areas were interconnected, that specialization in
feeding and environment as well as infertility among animals
of the same type associated with such localized adaptation occurred after
the flood, which is why the fossils of already specialized animals are
subsequent to said specialization and location, which in just a few
few tens of years can achieve great diversity in appearance in
the same type of animal, this and that.

#### First thing's first.

It doesn't really matter how much evidence or arguments are
have of the possibility that the biblical narrative is possible and
true, if you don't first believe that all those animals and that those 8
people, by logical necessity, had to be created by a Creator
and designer with an intelligence and knowledge that the man of today
day, with today's technology, you can hardly imagine.

And in order to accept that it really was so, and that the biblical narrative
is historical, it is almost rationally impossible to accept it without first
believe that Jesus Christ is alive because after dying on the cross
resurrected

The testimony about Jesus Christ is that he spoke of Noah as an event
history, then if the testimony that Jesus Christ was resurrected is true
the biblical narrative must be authentic.

That is why when this part of the video began, emphasis was placed on
these two biblical principles:

1. There is a Creator, designer and intelligent, of all plants, animals and
    person on this planet.
2. Jesus Christ is alive because, after dying on the cross, the Creator
    He raised him on the third day.

If these two fundamental points are denied, ignored, or not taken
taken into account, it is almost rationally unattainable to be able to believe that the
Noah's story is authentic.

That God, who the biblical narrative says spoke to Noah, was the same
He made sure that everything happened as it is written in the bible. The
always has been and will be in control. Nothing absolutely nothing takes it
by surprise. That is the God of the Bible.

If you don't believe in that God, only he can make you believe and drag you
to his son Jesus Christ. The promise is that He, someday, sooner or later
of the resurrection of the dead, he will do it with you and he will do it with
EVERYONE, absolutely EVERYONE who has lived since Adam, is alive, and
They will live.

### History.

The ideal way to know the past would be to be able to repeat it at will
without affecting it. Something like watching the movie of any moment
past time in virtual reality and without intervening in its development.
But to really know it, it would also be necessary to be able to know what
that each person is thinking. What are the intentions of each
person. Being able to see inside the human heart.

Human beings still do not have access to such technology and even
A few years ago, video was something that could only be recorded with
very expensive equipment. In addition, the human being only had access to the
video technology until the 20th century. And photography was only achieved
until the 19th century. That is why the history before the 19th century is
seeks to know it from two types of sources or evidence: the
written and physical objects.

Even only until the 15th century, with the construction of the first
movable type printing press was that the written medium began to
overcrowd Before the printing press, every book had to be copied to
hand and therefore quite expensive for the average person.
The printing press taught the common person to read because it allowed
have access to the written medium.

The historian, according to fashionable criteria, must be a scholar, is
say a person with sufficient training for the task. The ideal
is that said person has the sole motivation to communicate the facts,
the truth, no matter how difficult it is to accept. no interest
political, economic or religious. Must have the ability to summarize
without omitting, and to write in a coherent and interesting way.

In written sources, the ideal is that said source is the closest
to the events, which has been written by a person with the
characteristics mentioned, that the origin of said source is known, and
that in case a long time has passed, the copies of said source
be as reliable as possible. That said copies have been made
by people trained to do so, with the greatest possible fidelity and
methodical way. It is also desirable to have more than one reliable source.
about the same events. In this way it is possible to cross the different
sources. It is desirable to have copies of different instants in time,
in order to compare if the narration has been modified, thus subtracting
credibility. It is desirable that the names of people and places be
completely consistent with the rest of the sources, including the
archaeological.

The irony is that when one person or a group of people searches,
really research, compare, analyze, collect sources and compare them, and
over time he concludes that, by comparison, in each
of the fucking mentioned above, the best compilation of sources
written history that exists is precisely the bible, that person of
suddenly becomes, in the eyes of those who haven't done their homework,
PRE-judgmental.

The one who was judicious in doing the task is the "prejudicial" in the eyes
of those who have not done their homework, of those who form a judgment before
of doing homework, of the PRE-judicious. She is accused of being "washed
the brain”, as if it were a bad thing, by those who still have the
sick mind, DIRTY and DEAD. Because it is Jesus Christ who washes us,
cleanses, takes away our sin and gives us LIFE, with his holy spirit,
not only to our brain, but to our mind and the rest of our
body.

Some who start the task, but do not finish it and do it halfway,
as the most internationally renowned institute of history dedicated
to promote the story of evolution, even recognizes that, and I open
quotes, "much of the Bible, particularly the historical books of the
Old Testament, are historical documents as accurate as
any we have from ancient times and are in fact MORE accurate than
many of the Egyptian, Mesopotamian and Greek stories”, I close
quotation marks. Sure, this is just a translation from English, which is the
language in which said institute of propaganda of the lie of
the evolution, of the story of the toad. And that of course does not consider the
Genesis as part of your comment.

The Book of Genesis, or Bereshit in Hebrew, has always been considered
by its readers as a historical book with the exception of the two
last centuries. The literary style of Genesis tells us that it is a
historical narration and was thus considered by its readers throughout
the whole story. Only until the 19th century, when the
lie of evolution, was that even among believers in
Jesus Christ began to see himself differently.

But it is not the only case in which the veracity of the
Bible. He has happened with people like Nimrod, David, Balthazar, Pilate,
Darius, with cities or empires like Akkad, Ur, the Hittites, and Nineveh
before being RE-discovered or identified they were used to
discredit the veracity of the bible, only for later,
after being RE-found or identified, being ignored or
despised as evidence of Biblical truthfulness by those
PRE-judicious.

The Bible is first used to discredit its historicity and when
confirm, you are ignored. Many of the historians who initially
doubt the veracity of the bible, once they finish the task, they come to
the conclusion that it is completely reliable and then they are simply
ignored as if they had always held that position.

One of the most important archaeologists and scholars, one of the
opponents in the 19th century of the book of the Acts of the Apostles as
historically reliable, after finishing his task, he arrived at the
conclusion that Luke in each of his mentions of 32 countries, 54
cities, 9 Mediterranean islands and 95 people of historical renown
He didn't make a single mistake.

The bible presents much more rigor and accuracy than what is
observed in modern cases such as the popular British encyclopedia that, in
the first year of its publication, contained so many errors regarding
places in the United States that had to be collected.

Until only the last century, one of the arguments, or rather
apologies, against the historical reliability of the old
testament was that the oldest copy, the oldest manuscript, was
900 after Jesus Christ. Once they were found
scrolls from Qumram, near the Dead Sea, in Israel, dating from about
thousand years before, and compared with those that were held, the conclusion of
the preservation of the old testament became undeniable.

archaeological evidence? The archaeological record of entire cities,
entire empires, entire civilizations, the entire planet in its
geological features is evidence of the truth of the bible.

The problem is not in the evidence, that our Creator guarantees that
will preserve, but in the heart of man, that which also guarantees us
who will circumcise in due time.

We were made to worship our Creator, for our own good.

The Bible is historically reliable.

### The spine.

In the bible there are a series of verses that give us a column of
events. A series of verses that if placed temporally make
impossible to deny what the bible says about the history of the
humanity.

The date King Solomon began construction of YHWH's temple
can be ratified externally by synchronisms with the chronology of
the neo-Assyrians.

In addition to the large amount of archaeological information regarding the
chronology of the kings recorded in the books of Kings and Chronicles
in the bible they also confirm that Solomon began the construction of the
temple in the year 966 before Jesus Christ.

From this date it can be established when the exodus took place according to
the Bible. In 1st Kings 6 it says that "AND IT WAS in the year
four hundred and eighty after the children of Israel came out of
Egypt, in the fourth year from the beginning of Solomon's reign over
Israel, in the month of Ziph, which is the second month, which he began to
build the house of the Lord” [^702]. Mathematical subtraction tells us that
the exodus began in the year 1446 before Jesus Christ.

In Exodus 4 it says that: "The time that the children of Israel
they dwelt in Egypt, it was four hundred and thirty years. and past
four hundred and thirty years, on the same day all the armies went out
of Jehovah from the land of Egypt” [^703]. Mathematical subtraction tells us
that in 1876 before Jesus Christ was the year that Jacob entered Egypt
with the Israelites, when Joseph was already second in command in
Egypt. At that time Joseph sent chariots to pick up Jacob and his family.
who was in Beersheba.

And with the generations given in Genesis 5 and 11, the age that Abraham
fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, the age at which Jacob died, and the time
that Jacob lived in Egypt, data that we all find in Genesis, is
Can you calculate the dates of birth and death of each of the
people from those genealogies back to Adam.

This mathematical operation gives us a date on which the events occurred.
events narrated in Genesis 1 and 2 from a few thousand years ago. NOT
tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands, not millions of years. That is what
what the bible says. The one that God promises to protect, keep and
preserve.

These three dates establish the biblical column of the history of the
humanity on this planet.

1. In 966 before Jesus Christ Solomon began the construction of the
    temple.
2. In 1446 before Jesus Christ the exodus began.
3. In 1876 before Jesus Christ Jacob entered Egypt.

### Genealogies.

The genealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 add up to a total of different years
depending on the manuscript you read. There are 2 large groups of
manuscripts, two great traditions of manuscripts, of which
derive the texts of Genesis that we read today in our own
idiom:

1. Manuscripts derived from the Septuagint and
2. Manuscripts derived from the Masoretic.

The genealogies of the Septuagint always add up to more than a thousand years by
higher than the sum of those of the Masoretic. Both cannot be in
Right.

Under the principles of this section only one of the two is true.

This means that one of two:

1. The Masoretic is true and the Septuagint lengthened the ages by
    that the parents had their children in the Masoretic EXTENDING thus
    the complete chronology, or exclusively
2. The Septuagint is true and the Masoretic shortened the ages by
    that parents had their children in the Septuagint SHORTENING thus
    the complete chronology of the Septuagint.

In the discipline of textual criticism the most important of the
fundamental principles, called canons, is that: “in a difference
among manuscripts, the manuscript that can best explain the others is
the most probably correct.

The arguments and evidence that allow this host to prefer
the chronology we find in the Septuagint are:

1. As of the date of this video, and for the text of the chronologies in
    Genesis 5 and 11, the Septuagint manuscripts are much more
    older than those of the Masoretic. The codex Vaticanus and the codex
    Sinaiticus of the Septuagint are dated to the 4th century while
    the Aleppo codex and the Leningrad Codex of Masoretics are
    dated to the 10th and 11th century. This may change, for the text in
    question, with the manuscripts in Hebrew found in Qumram and that
    have not been published yet.
2. The reason that can be argued to EXTEND an alleged
    original Masoretic chronology is that it was desired to make
    consistent the chronology of Genesis with the Egyptian chronologies
    before the Septuagint, in particular that of Manetho in the nineteenth century.
    3 before Jesus Christ. If in the middle of the 3rd century before
    Jesus Christ, when the Hebrew scriptures were translated into Greek and
    produced the Septuagint, the motive was to make the scriptures consistent
    Hebrew chronologies with Egyptian chronologies, this objective does not
    was achieved. The Septuagint chronology is not consistent with
    none of the Egyptian chronologies of that time, in particular the
    of Manetho that does not take into account any of the co-reigns and
    parallel kingdoms that have been deduced in modern chronologies of
    Egypt. Much less the elongated Egyptian chronologies of that
    moment that lengthened the chronology of Egypt even to be 7
    and 8 millennia of existence. To be consistent with any of these
    chronologies, the Septuagint would have to have a much larger chronology.
    longer than the one you have in any case. The alleged reason
    to EXTEND an original chronology was NOT fulfilled.
3. The reason that can be argued to SHORTEN an alleged
    original chronology of the Septuagint is that it was desired to deny the
    reliability of the Septuagint as a text of the Tanakh for the Jews
    and in this way prevent the Jewish population from reading the texts of the
    new testament that were being distributed as part of the
    Septuagint for the growing Christian movement. If this was the
    objective, it was achieved, even to the point that today we have to
    argue why in genealogies the reliability of the
    Septuagint is older. The use of the Septuagint by the
    Jewish population declines markedly in years when the
    Seder-Olam-Rabbah chronology, based on an alleged chronology
    original Masoretic, began to be distributed by the authority
    rabbinical among the Jewish population of the 2nd century. The alleged reason
    to SHORTEN an original chronology IF it was FULFILLED.
4. The most important event in all of human history is the
    resurrection of Jesus Christ. Seems like a much more important reason.
    try to hide or prevent the Jewish population from learning of all
    the evidence that the new testament shows in favor of Jesus Christ
    like the Jewish Meshiakh, who try to coordinate the chronology of the
    tanakh, the sacred text of the Jews, and therefore of supreme
    importance to the Jewish translators who produced the
    Septuagint, with chronologies of the uncircumcised like the Greeks
    or the Egyptians. The reason for SHORTENING the chronology is much more
    stronger than the reason to EXTEND the chronology.
5. There is no witness between the time of the alleged ELONGATION
    of the chronologies in the production of the Septuagint and the
    destruction of the second temple that accuses the Septuagint of altering
    the chronologies of Genesis 5 and 11. No witness reports a
    lengthening of the chronology up to the time of the alleged
    shortening. The Septuagint is accused of EXTENDING the chronology
    Late very late.
6. There are several witnesses of the first centuries after the alleged
    SHORTENING of the chronologies in the Masoretics that accuse the
    rabbis of altering the chronologies of Genesis 5 and 11. Among them,
    Eusebius in 310 after Jesus Christ, Julián de Toledo a
    mid-600 after Jesus Christ, and James of Edessa also to
    mid 600 after Jesus Christ. Thus, several witnesses
    denounce a shortening of the chronology shortly after the alleged
    shortening. The Masoretics are accused of SHORTENING the chronology
    soon very soon.
7. The only external witness, prior to the destruction of the second
    temple in Jerusalem, which partially ratifies the short chronology
    of Masoretics is the Book of Jubilees. This book has been dated
    from the 2nd century BC and considered as pseudo-epigraphy
    by almost all of Christianity from its inception, with the rare
    exception of the Ethiopians, and is not even considered canonical by
    the same Jews, with the exception of the Ethiopian Jews.
    Pseudo-epigraphy means FALSEly titled, in this case someone
    he writes it in the 2nd century before Jesus Christ, and tries to simulate that
    It was written in the time of Moses. The only external witness in favor
    of the Masoretic chronology is a pseudo-epigraphy.
8. The 11QJub coded fragment set found in Qumram is the
    unique containing parts of the 4th chapter of the Book of Jubilees
    according to a popular Dead Sea Scroll list. Nevertheless
    it is very difficult to imagine the schoolboy who was able to put something together
    even readable of the verses that are supposedly
    supported by 11QJub fragments. In the portal
    [www.deadseascrolls.org.il](http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/)
    you can see a photographic record of 11QJub and this host does not
    found a single scholarly article identifying the fragments
    by plate and fragment number that support the chronology
    found in more recent manuscripts. Thus, your host has the
    position that the Qumran manuscripts do not ratify the chronology
    found in the Book of Jubilees. And thus the chronology
    found in current copies of the Book of Jubilees may
    simply be based on the Masoretic because its preservation has
    been in the hands of Orthodox Jews. The ONLY outside witness to
    favor of the Masoretic chronology may not even be.
9. There are multiple external witnesses that confirm the chronology
    length of the Septuagint before the destruction of the second temple
    in Jerusalem. Among them, the Demetrius chronograph in the 220 before
    of Jesus Christ, Eupolemus in 160 before Jesus Christ, and so
    very important, The Book of Biblical Antiquities of the 1st century
    because internal and external evidence indicates that it was written in
    Hebrew, by Hebrews, in Hebrew land, and therefore could not be
    based on the Septuagint. Outside witnesses show that even
    the destruction of the second temple, the genealogies in both
    traditions were those of the Septuagint.
10. Also in a special way, as an external witness, is the disputed
    case of the prestigious Jewish historian Josephus, in the 1st century
    after Jesus Christ. The case is disputed because there is evidence
    of intentional corruption in the copy of its originals. Josephus
    affirms that he worked directly from the Hebrew, which rules out that his
    chronology was based on the Septuagint. His translation of
    Biblical names into Greek does not correspond to that of the
    Septuagint, but it is a proper transliteration of Josephus, which
    which confirms its affirmation and its independence from the Septuagint. The
    evidence of corruption is established because in various parts of his
    manuscripts Josephus is found to assert a sum total of his
    chronology consistent with the long Septuagint chronology, but
    in some manuscripts the chronology as such only adds up to a total
    short as the Masoretic. Thus, although the chronology as such
    that survives today in the manuscripts that copied the originals
    of Josephus corresponds mostly to the Masoretic chronology,
    Josephus himself asserts elsewhere a lump sum for his
    chronology that corresponds is with the Septuagint. hard to believe
    that man did not know how to add. At least until destruction
    of the second temple, the genealogies in both traditions were those of
    the Septuagint.
11. The flood begins in the year 600 of Noah according to Genesis 7. It is more
    easy to explain why the chronological data for Jared,
    Methuselah and Lamech are the same in both chronologies of Genesis 5 in
    a context that shortens the chronology than in a context that lengthens
    the chronology. In a context that shortens the chronology, one cannot
    shorten by one hundred the age at which children are born for these three
    Gentlemen, as was done with the rest, because they would have survived the
    flood along with Noah. In a context that lengthens the chronology this
    problem would not have existed. It is easier to explain the chronology
    Masoretic from the Septuagint than the opposite.
12. It is easier to explain the difference of only 50 years in the age in
    that Nacor has his son in a context that shortens the chronology
    than in a context that lengthens the chronology. In a context that
    shorten the chronology you cannot shorten by a hundred the age at which
    Nahor's son is born, as was done with the rest, because he would have
    had before his own birth. In a context that lengthens the
    chronology this problem would not have existed. It's easier to explain
    the Masoretic chronology from the Septuagint that
    contrary.
13. The number of levels in the archaeological evidence of the cultures
    Egyptian and Mesopotamian are easier to explain in chronology
    long Septuagint than in the short Masoretic.

Just as in some judicial systems it is established whether the presumed
culprit had the means, the opportunity and the motive to commit a
crime. It is clear that the evidence and logic indicates that these aspects
are met much more easily for a shortening of the chronology
by the rabbis that for a lengthening of the chronology in
production times of the Septuagint. after the destruction
of the second temple the rabbis had the motive, the opportunity and the
means to shorten the original chronology.

On the other hand, the evidence and logic indicate that the text of the
Masoretic is explained from a change in the Septuagint much more
easily than the text in the Septuagint from a change in the
Masoretic. Thus, the main canon of textual criticism points to the
veracity of the Septuagint.

### Eridu.

The famous story of the tower of Babel is found in Genesis 11.

If we can believe the story of Noah, it is not so difficult to believe a good one.
translation of the story in Genesis 11. Some 50 years after the
death of Noah, the people still spoke only one language, the one that
Noah and his family spoke. God had commanded Noah to
would scatter and populate the whole earth, but some rebels did not
believed Noah and decided to build a city and a tower so as not to be
scattered. YHWH makes them scatter anyway, maybe
simply with the death of a certain Nimrod, who was the one who directed the
matter, and the construction of the city and the tower stop. The
scatter and settle in separate places does what it always does
and each group forms its own cultural identity including its own
language, and retaining something of the grandiose idea of ​​building pyramids
and that is why we observe them in all ancient cultures. the city in
that the rebellion began is commemorated with a name that alludes
to the topic.

The arguments and the evidence that allow this host to affirm
that the ancient city of Eridu, of ancient Mesopotamia, located in the
Tel-Abu-Shahrain location near Basra, IS the Babel of Genesis 11
are the following:

1. It is in the right place and construction began at the time
    suitable: ancient Mesopotamia, cradle of the first
    civilizations or cities. It makes no sense to look for Babel in the
    6th century before Jesus Christ. Or any other time when
    look at various written languages ​​on the planet. or in any
    moment that contradicts the biblical chronology. It can't be in the
    2000 before Jesus Christ, the time of Abraham, or in the 1500 before
    Jesus Christ, times of Moses. Or in the area of ​​South America or in the
    Chinese area. Additionally, ancient Mesopotamia is close to
    the mountains of Ararat, the landing place of Noah.
2. There was a massive migration that left the area and was recorded
    in the traces of artifacts and architectures, in the evidence
    archaeological. This migration is known as expansion.
    Uruk. Expansion so scattered, prolonged, and distant that it is easily
    could have been called the Eridu expansion because the two cities are so
    nearby that is archaeologically indistinguishable from which of the two
    expansion began.
3. It has the appropriate name because Eridu is synonymous with Babel in the
    ancient Mesopotamia. Even the Babel or Babylon of times of
    Abraham was also known as Eridu.
4. It had the largest temple or ziggurat at the time, by far, with
    more than 15 distinguishable stages. And next to said ziggurat there is a
    huge platform also started in the Uruk period, abandoned
    for several periods, and ended at a much later period to
    build a normal sized ziggurat on top of it. I never know
    I build on top something consistent with its area. The area of ​​bliss
    platform is larger than the sum of the areas of the main
    complexes of the later pyramids of Egypt. The approximate area
    of the Éridu platform, using the famous Internet portal of
    satellite maps, is 358 thousand square meters, while the
    area of ​​the great pyramid of Giza is a little less than 53 thousand meters
    squares. It is almost 300 thousand square meters larger than the area
    of the pyramids, and almost 7 times the area of ​​the pyramids. The
    Eridu platform is gigantic.
5. The other candidate cities do not meet all the conditions. EITHER
    they are not at the right time, or they are not in a place where
    part of an archaeologically recorded mass migration, or not
    they have a TEMPLE the size that Eridu had. and no account
    with a PLATFORM of the size like the one started in Éridu. It was
    simply gigantic.
6. The Sumerian witness of ancient Mesopotamia “Enmerkar and the Lord of
    Aratta” confirms the story point by point. there was only one
    language, they wanted to build a huge ziggurat in Eridu, the god of
    Eridu stopped construction, there was a scattering, and the god of Eridu
    confused the languages.
7. Some versions of the Sumerian king list name the king of
    Eridu as the first, which is consistent with biblical data
    of Nimrod.
8. The deities of Eridu are related to a flood
    planetary.

The Bible allows us to think that some 400 years after the time of
Nimrod, that is to say from the time of Babel or Eridu, in the time of Peleg, the
granite shell that was torn during the planetary flood,
settled more quickly than it had been doing, let's say in a
period of about two hundred years with an average of 10 centimeters per
month, and the water ended up covering and separating the points that allowed
that the human being expanded throughout the planet during those 400
years.

All the evidence indicates that the story of Babel is the story of
Eridu.

### Monumental Egypt.

The year 525 after Jesus Christ was the first year after
Jesus Christ, when a monk calculated that Jesus Christ must have been born
525 years ago. From that moment on, the measuring system was generated.
the years used by the entire planet today. System that has no year
zero because from year 1 before Jesus Christ you go directly to year 1
after Jesus Christ. And that is also why, according to some experts,
Jesus Christ ends up being born in 5 before Jesus Christ.

Before this absolute and global system of the king of kings, of the lord of
Gentlemen, from the owner of the planet, the way to identify a date was
dependent on the little king on duty. Each event was identified by
the year of the reign under which it happened. That is to say the same thing as now,
only with each little king, because the king of kings had not arrived.

This is why the most reliable method to determine a previous event
Jesus Christ has to take into account each little king on duty, the number
of years that he reigned, that another little king on duty was reigning at the SAME
time, the different names by which the SAME
little king on duty, the different ways of counting a reign, either through
from the first full year, from the first moment in which he began to
govern, in which solar or lunar month the year began for the culture of the
little king, if the reign was counted from when he began to rule or from
that the father king was dying, or any other way of counting that was
it would have happened to the culture of the day. Every chronology of every little king
You must take these details into account.

Synchronisms, those relationships that accept that two people, places
or events between different historical sources correspond to the SAME
person, place or event, are the bridges that allow to establish
moments that occurred simultaneously between two chronologies of
different reigns. This is the glue, which allows you to join the
chronologies of each little king with each other and in this way to put together
a global timeline.

In addition to these regional dates and synchronisms,
must also cross this information with that obtained in the sequences
established by the layers or levels of ARCHAEOLOGICAL artifacts in
the urban settlements of each kingdom, of each culture that suggest
a sequence of events.

Details, details, details, that added together can double or triple the
total time of a chronology if they are not taken into account or set
wrong relations, wrong synchronisms.

The Rosseta stone was the archaeological artifact that allowed us to begin
to decode the hieroglyphs of Egypt because they contained the same text
in three different forms including Greek and Egyptian hieroglyphs.
The archaeological evidence found in Egypt is literally
monumental. The gigantic monuments are full of sayings
hieroglyphics and being able to decipher them was an archaeological achievement
literally monumental.

The French champion who became famous for decoding hieroglyphs
in the famous stone, also formulated the most historical synchrony
IMPORTANT from the popular Egyptian chronology: That the little king, or better
said little pharaoh, because he is from Egypt, named in the bible, eye IN THE
BIBLE, like Shishak in 1st Kings 14 [^704], was exactly the same
Sheshonk 1st of the Egyptian 22nd dynasty according to Manetho. to the champion
they seemed to sound alike and therefore must be the same person.
Shishak is Sheshonk.

The Bible says that “in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of
Egypt against Jerusalem” [^705], and according to the champion, that should be the
same Sheshonk who attacked Israel. The champion didn't even know that he
Sheshonk went to the north of Israel, not to Judah, where it is
Jerusalem, and therefore could not be the same person. The champion,
Based on biblical chronology, he knew that Rehoboam's fifth year
corresponds to 925 before Jesus Christ, and therefore that should be the
date that the certain Sheshonk 1st of the 22nd dynasty attacked Israel.

And once the champion said it, that's how it stayed. The reason to trust
Biblical date for Shishak, NOT Sheshonk, is that the historical sources,
including archaeological information, and exceptionally
astronomical records of the Neo-Babylonian reigns, and the system
neo-Assyrian of lunar years, have allowed to confirm, verify,
ratify, in multiple ways, the biblical information subsequent to
Solomon, corresponding to the time of kings and prophets in Israel. Everything
post-Solomon has been confirmed in multiple ways. For him
champion it was easy to trust the date of 925 BC for the
moment when the bible says that Shishak, NOT Sheshonk, plundered
Jerusalem.

Based on the champion's timing, that Shishak is Sheshonk, this
substantiated ALL Egyptian chronology prior to 750 before
Jesus Christ. AND ALL the chronologies, of the ancient cultures of the
Mediterranean, are based on the Egyptian chronology to fix dates
absolute prior to 750 BC. in particular the Assyrian
and the Greek, are based on the Egyptian chronology. It's a ball of
snow.

Before the Egyptologists arrived, the Mycenaean period, from the
Greek culture, non-messianic Mycenaean eye, that of the famous Troy and of
Agamemnon, the one in the film, was dated between 1000 before
Jesus Christ and the 750 before Jesus Christ, because all the evidence
archaeological and written information indicates this, as well as the synchronicities with the
Assyrian culture. But when archaeological artifacts from
Mycenaean culture in the middle of the 18th dynasty of Egypt, the chronology
champion's Egyptian won and NOTE that the Mycenaeans were no longer among
1000 and 750 before Jesus Christ but they became between the
1700 and 1000 before Jesus Christ. The entire Greek Mycenaean period
lengthened and regressed about 500 years on average. the egyptian evidence
it was monumental, literally, and the champion had to be absolutely right. The
validity of the Egyptian chronology of the champion with all the errors of
Manetho in chronological sums of SIMULTANEOUS reigns was never
questioned. And since the Greeks exchanged their pottery with the
cultures of almost the entire Mediterranean, PLEASE NOTE that these cultures also
They went back about 500 years on average.

The same thing happened to the Hittites. Archaeological evidence was found
that Ramses 2nd of the Egyptian 19th dynasty fought those guys and HAVE
that the Hittites also went back another 500 years and lengthened
as much. The Egyptian chronology had to be correct. and despite
that the enormous local evidence in the layer sequences
archaeological data indicates that the culture that inhabited between 1000 before
Jesus Christ and 750 BC, in what is now Turkey
south-eastern and northern Syria, is exactly the same of these types
Hittites, the current interpretation that we read in the online encyclopedia
is that such Hittites lived about 500 years before.

These little errors generated what is known as the DARK AGES of the
Greeks and Assyrians. Those periods in which supposedly MISSING
the evidence that they even EXISTED! Not that two layers
immediate, followed, contiguous archaeological sites in an urban settlement
of these cultures indicate two periods, one immediately prior to the
other. Noooooo, that would indicate that the Egyptian chronology of the champion is
wrong. What happens is that, between those two layers in a row,
adjoining, immediate, THE EVIDENCE IS MISSING, 500 years old, that they HAVE to
have happened, because this is indicated by the chronology on which we base
all our dates. Absurd, right? But that's how we are. Says the
encyclopedia.

Based on the champion's synchronism and Manetho's cheerful accounts,
the exodus would have to have happened a few dynasties later than the 22nd,
in the 19th, during the reign of Ramses 2nd, who obviously did not drown
in the Red Sea, as the bible affirms that happened to the pharaoh of the exodus,
because we have your MUMMY. Just as we have the mummy of ALL
pharaohs of the 18th and 19th dynasties. Is it then concluded that the
the champion's synchronization is incorrect?, that no little pharaoh of the
18th and 19th dynasties, in Manetho's accounts, may be the pharaoh of the
Exodus? and that therefore the Egyptian chronology is 500
years old? Noooooo, what most of the academy concludes is that the
bible was wrong in that little detail, or that the interpretation of the
verses that tells us that the little pharaoh of the exodus drowned in the sea
Red doesn't go that far, the guy didn't even get wet, and that's why
we have the mummy.

On the other hand, based on champion timing and accounts
joyous Manetho, Jericho should have archaeological evidence of having
been destroyed during one of the archaeological layers
corresponding to one of the pharaohs of the 18th or 19th dynasties. And
as there is not, as Jericho was NOT destroyed during ANY dynasty
after 15, because the archaeological evidence indicates so, is it
conclude that the champion's timing is incorrect? and that for what
So, is the Egyptian chronology 500 years old? noooo, i know
concludes that Jericho was NOT destroyed when the Bible says so, but much
before and that when Joshua arrived there was nothing to conquer, and everything
was destroyed.

That is to say that the biblical date in which Shishak sacked Jerusalem is used
to say what was the date that this Sheshonk disque looted
Jerusalem, which he never did because the guy went north,
to then say that the exodus of the bible never happened because in the
dynasty calculated from that date NO evidence found
archeology of no exodus. Typical example of circular argumentation,
but it is not questioned that this Sheshonk was NEVER the Shishak of the
Bible. Noooooo, the champion was not wrong. The one that was wrong was the
bible and only when it serves to discredit it. The exodus never happened
according to the champion's bible. Absurd, right? But that's how we are. Says the
encyclopedia.

The monumental error of biblical interpretation has served to deny the
biblical truth.

### ur.

The Mesopotamian Neo-Sumerian urban settlement known as Ur
has a number of features consistent with the Ur of the Chaldeans
Biblical city, the city from which Abram's father left, because he had not yet
his name was Abraham, with part of his family, because Nacor stayed:

1. It is in Mesopotamia, the land watered by what Noah thought were
    the Tigris and Euphrates rivers before the flood,
2. It is close to Eridu, Nimrod's babel.
3. It is in the land of Shinar, ancient Sumeria.
4. It was the land of the Chaldeans.

Archaeological evidence has been found in Ur that details some of the
its technological advances.

At the beginning of the 19th century, a wooden artifact was found, known
as "The Standard of Ur", in the tomb of what is believed to have been a king of
the 3rd dynasty of Ur. The artifact is a wooden box that shows in
drawings something of the culture of Ur. In it you can see animals pulling
wooden carts in which up to two people are mounted.

If Noah's story is true, these animals would be those of the
which adapted a good part of the equines.

If the bible is true and Ur is Ur, Abraham, when he was still called
Abram was in Egypt with his people almost 25 years before he was born
his son Isaac, even before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is
hard to imagine that his father, who died before Abram finished
the trip to Egypt, when he left Ur with Abram, he will FORGET to throw
their little things, and their people, in cars that we know people had
of Ur.

However, the online encyclopedia and the vast majority of
Egyptologists would have us believe that the Egyptians did not know about the
use of chariots for warfare or for transportation until the
descendants of Abraham had already left Egypt about 500 years old
after Abraham had visited Egypt in his chariots brought from
Ur.

Not. That Ur is not Ur. Since they don't find cars around there
little drawings among the tombs and mummies, which they interpret as
after the 15th dynasty, they knew nothing about chariots. And that he
wheel-shaped glyph is observed from the earliest dynasties. NOT,
they have to see the whole car drawn, otherwise it is not worth it. that the pharaoh
of the exodus cannot be earlier than the 15th dynasty because only up to that
moment they found out that cars existed. why not
find archaeological artifacts of all the cars made by the
of Sumeria, those of Akkad, and all the other Mesopotamian cultures that
followed them, then NONE of the Egyptians who lived in the
dynasties before the 15th saw chariots they made all
those cultures. Could it be that all those cultures NEVER did all the
cars what did they do?

Well, they will find NOTHING! If the vast majority of all those
cars were 100 percent BIODEGRADABLE! Can't you see they were made of wood?
Probably at the time of the exodus, in 1446 before Jesus Christ, in
the 13th dynasty of Egypt, only the pharaoh and his personal guard would have
carts with metal wheels.

They try to make us believe that never, for more than a thousand years,
Egyptians had contact with the people who lived in Ur, whether or not they were from
Abram, nor with the cultures that followed him in ancient Mesopotamia.
Noooooo, they were completely isolated, and alone, and they never knew each other.
They found out about the horse-drawn cart. No, what a cart, what a wagon,
which are not horses, anything but chariot. who were such
Hyksos who finally brought the chariot to Egypt in the 15th. That's what
read in the online encyclopedia.

And Abraham? Or rather Abram. Wasn't that in a car? And ur? Do not
was Ur? It doesn't really matter, because the ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE, that
that must be interpreted in any case, the one with which they give so much
mallet, indicates the opposite. That since the time of Abram, the Egyptians already
They HAD to know about the car.

Obviously it would not be a formula One, but a formula Ur, those made of wood, of
integral, biodegradable wheels, of which we see there little drawings in El
Banner of Ur, and not to call it a chariot, culture experts
Sumerian, they call it that dial wagon, or cart, or anything but
car.

So no cart, from Ur THE CAR was already used for war and
for transportation, a thousand years before the descendants of Abraham
out of Egypt, the same Abram who traveled from Ur to Egypt, in CHARIOTS
of Ur, before the 3rd dynasty.

### Sodoma and Gomorra.

Sodom and Gomorrah are just the first two cities on the plain.
of the Jordan that the bible affirms that they were burned by God with rain
of burning sulfur and that were turned into ashes.

Lot left Sodom for Zoar at the time of Sodom's destruction,
but God takes him out of the cities he is going to destroy and finally ends
where God had told him to go first: on the mountain. What
the cities of the plain had been destroyed by rain of sulfur
burning and turned to ashes, Lot's daughters believe that there is no
no man on earth and decide to have children with Lot.

Along the western shore of the Dead Sea in Israel are
at least 4 large unique areas on the planet due to their composition
chemical and other physical characteristics that make them distinguishable from
simple view of the geological formations around it.

In them, large structures composed mainly of
calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate with geometric shapes
consistent with what would be expected to be found if large constructions
made of LIMESTONE were destroyed by burning SULFUR RAIN
in those areas. Forms consistent with what
would be the remains of walls, doors, windows, ziggurats, sphinxes and
constructions originally made of LIMESTONE.

The arguments and the evidence that allow this host to affirm
than the remains of the cities of the Jordan plain, described in
the book of Genesis as destroyed by Jehovah with rain of brimstone
burning, ARE the structures that are observed in these areas along
of the Dead Sea are the following:

1. The more than 1.5 million graves estimated to be found in
    this area that is now completely deserted and in which no
    no one has inhabited for thousands of years, it is only explained if in a
    previous moment there were large cities in that area. This evidence is
    consistent with the biblical narrative.
2. The graves present evidence consistent with an area that in a
    She was quite fertile at the time. Leftovers from many kinds of food
    found in these tombs. This evidence is consistent with the
    biblical narrative.
3. They are in a place consistent with the biblical narrative: in what is
    called the plains of the Jordan.
4. The chemical reaction product of the interaction of carbonate of
    calcium, sulfur dioxide, and oxygen, is the formation of sulfate of
    calcium and carbon dioxide. The chemical composition of
    structures is perfectly consistent with such a chemical reaction
    that describes what would happen to buildings built with
    LIMESTONE that are burned with a rain of capsules
    burning sulfur tablets, i.e. in the manner described in
    biblical narrative.
5. The structures are penetrated by millions of said capsules of
    sulfur with different diameters. The sulfur capsules are
    embedded in the middle of the thin thin layers of carbonate of
    calcium and calcium sulfate that make up the structures. This is
    perfectly consistent with the biblical narrative which tells us that
    the cities were destroyed by a rain of burning brimstone.
6. The sulfur purity of these capsules is 98% on average.
    Unique on the planet. The sulfur found in geothermal areas does not
    exceeds 45%.
7. The biblical description of the cities being turned to ashes is
    perfectly consistent with the observed structures. The
    surfaces of the thin layers that make up the structures of the
    area dissolve when touched.
8. The structures present evidence consistent with having achieved
    very high temperatures. The thin layers that make up the
    structures present eddies that would be the result of
    the thermal ionization suffered by these layers during their
    combustion.
9. The geometric shapes of the structures are consistent with what
    which would be the remains of walls, doors, windows, ziggurats,
    sphinxes and buildings originally made of limestone.
10. There is evidence indicating that throughout history there have been
    identified the structures with the biblical narrative. The
    historian Josephus claims to have visited the cities and even to have
    seen the ashes of what would be Lot's wife. and there is evidence
    of a church once built in the area.

Better said: white is chicken, put it, fried and eat it with bread. Are
too many coincidences, those that have an exponential effect when
accumulate. And if you want to dismiss all the evidence by saying that the
Biblical narration is assembled based on pre-existing structures,
would still have to explain the number of tombs found in the
area and its content.

Seeing the evidence today is as easy as entering the famous page of
maps of the popular search portal and enter the coordinates 31 18
30.03N, 35 22 20.69E and drag the yellow dummy tool to
put the green dot on the blue circles and see photos
high-quality 360-degree panoramas of what once was

### Imhotep.

Synchronisms, those relationships that establish that two people,
places or events between different historical sources correspond to the
SAME person, place or event, are the bridges that allow to establish
moments that occurred simultaneously between two kingdom chronologies
different. In this way, the global chronological ladder of what
what happened in the past.

Due to the great problems with Manetho's gay accounts, with
the little mistake of the champion, and with the lies about the reign that each
pharaoh of turn commanded to put in hieroglyphs on gigantic
monuments that could be destroyed by his successors, the chronology
Egyptian culture finds, almost from its inception, a critic on duty who
presents its own synchronisms.

Recently there are like 5 or 6 Egyptologist experts trying to bring down the
champion. However, the champion's synchronism is still there: Shishak is
Sheshonk. Says the encyclopedia on the Internet. There must be a reason. The Bible
He explains it to us by saying that: "EVERYONE is set in evil"
[^706].

Next, the synchronism is sustained that: the Imhotep, of what
it is known as the 3rd Egyptian dynasty, it is the same Joseph of the book
biblical Genesis, the son of Jacob.

For this, the champion's little mistake is taken into account, the accounts
happy Manetho, and fundamentally the chronological column of the
bible presented above.

1. Imhotep appears suddenly in the reign of Pharaoh Djoser, the same
    than the Joseph of the bible.
2. Imhotep was first after the pharaoh, the same as Joseph of the
    Bible.
3. Imhotep interprets a dream of the pharaoh regarding a future
    famine of 7 years, the same as the Joseph of the bible.
4. Imhotep was not of royal blood, the same as the Joseph of the bible.
5. Imhotep saves Egypt from the 7-year famine by building
    grain stores, the same as the Joseph of the bible.
6. Imhotep was recognized as someone close to God, the same as the
    Joseph from the bible.
7. Imhotep imposed a tax on the inhabitants of Egypt, the same as
    the Joseph of the bible.
8. The post-famine pharaoh of Imhotep became very powerful,
    the same as the pharaoh of Joseph in the bible.
9. The corpse of Imhotep is not in his tomb in Egypt, the same as the
    corpse of Joseph from the bible.
10. The story of Imhotep became famous to the point that some
    they became mythical, the same as the story of Joseph in the bible.
11. Imhotep is famous for refusing to use magic in treatments.
    doctors, the same thing that would be expected of the Joseph of the bible.
12. The fact that Imhotep was the first to build a pyramid similar to
    a ziggurat is consistent with the biblical narrative. In the Bible,
    Abraham and Jacob would have knowledge about the ziggurats in
    Mesopotamia.
13. The fact that the pharaohs after the famine of Imhotep
    become so powerful is consistent with the biblical story. In
    the bible the inhabitants end up selling themselves as slaves of the
    pharaoh to be able to eat.

The main argument for not accepting synchronicity, that Imhotep is
the biblical Joseph, has been that the date for Imhotep in the chronology
Egyptian, based on the little mistake that Shishak is Sheshonk, is not
corresponds to the Biblical date for Joseph. If Shishak is not Sheshonk and
the champion was wrong, said argument is without support.

Since this synchronism, that Imhotep is Joseph, is not new, they have been
raised arguments based on the myth of Imhotep: that he had
unattainable knowledge for Jose, who was the representative of
Egyptian gods, and that this is incompatible with a Hebrew believer in the
God of Abraham, that Imhotep was a god not a man, that he accomplished things
that one would not expect from Jose.

The truth is that if the Egyptians themselves mythologized Imhotep until the
point of making him a demi-god, all the supposed Egyptian data of
Imhotep that are not supported by different sources are also not very
reliable.

The coincidences mentioned between Imhotep and the biblical narrative are
of widespread acceptance in academia is why the argument in
against synchronism was the temporal discrepancy. If it is temporarily
Synchronism is feasible, it is very difficult to deny that Imhotep is Jose.

### Nuweiba.

Unless you want to explain the biblical phrase from Exodus 14 that tells us
It says that "the children of Israel entered through the sea on DRY,
having the waters as a WALL to his right hand and to his left” [^707], or
be waters like WALL to the right and left of those who cross, of the
SAME way that some want to explain the biological systems that
we observe in plants, animals and people, that is, wanting to explain
those WALLS by MAGICAL processes, sorry SPONTANEOUS, which basically is
the same, and out of sheer CHEPA, without acknowledging, without accepting, DENYING, the hand
of the creator, of heaven and earth and of ALL biological systems
of the planet, to separate these waters into WALLS, it is relatively easy
accept what has to be the timing of the biblical place where
The crossing of the so-called Red Sea happened.

The crossing of the Red Sea happened almost in the middle of the Gulf of Aqaba in what
which is now known as Nuweiba.

The logical reasons and evidence that allow this host
assert synchronicity are:

1. Nuweiba is OUTSIDE of what was Egypt, although in a controlled area
    militarily by Egyptians, and the Bible tells us that the Israelites
    they had LEFT Egypt BEFORE crossing the Red Sea.
2. To the north of the peninsula where Nuweiba is, there is a desert and the
    The Bible tells us that Pharaoh believed they were shut up in the desert and
    He decided to go after them.
3. The desert to the north of the peninsula was the land of the Philistines and the
    The Bible tells us that God did not take them through the land of the Philistines.
    instead he directed them to a place called Pi-Hahirot.
4. Pi-Hahirot can be translated as "mouth of the cannon" and Nuweiba is
    in front of a mountainous canyon mouth.
5. The bible says that Pi-Hahirot is between Migdol and another place.
    Migdol can be translated as “fortified tower”, and north of
    Nuweiba there is evidence that a military tower once stood there
    of the Egyptians.
6. Until the last century, there was on both sides of the crossing point in
    Nuweiba, two large stone pillars with evidence indicating that
    They were from the time of Solomon.
7. There are eyewitnesses and photographs of the pillar on the side
    eastern, in Saudi Arabia, with evidence of words in several
    languages ​​such as: Pharaoh, Egypt, Moses, Death, Water, YHWH,
    Solomon and Edom.
8. The pillar on the western side can still be seen today in the
    year 2021.
9. Nuweiba's full name was Nuweiba-al-Muzayyinah which can be
    translate as “the waters of Moses part”.
10. This synchronism is consistent with the synchronism that Mount
    Biblical Sinai is the place known today as Jabal-Maqla in
    Saudi Arabia. That is to say that the coincidences of both synchronisms
    they reinforce each other.

### Jabal-Maqla.

According to the bible, something really happened on Mount Sinai or Horeb.
spectacular.

It says in Exodus 19 that: “And it came to pass on the third day when morning came,
that thunder and lightning came, and a thick cloud over the mountain, and
loud horn sound; and all the people that were in
the real. And Moses brought the people out of the camp to receive God; and they put on
at the bottom of the mountain. And all Mount Sinai smoked, because the Lord
had descended upon him in FIRE: and the smoke from him went up like the smoke
of a FURNACE, and the ENTIRE mountain SHAKED greatly. And the sound
horn was working extremely hard” [^708].

Then YHWH begins to enunciate, with a voice of thunder, all the
commandments, but there comes a time when Exodus 20 says that:
“All the people considered the VOICES, and the FLAMES, and the
sound of the trumpet, and the mountain that smoked: and when the people saw it,
They trembled, and stood at a distance. And they said to Moses: Speak with
we, that we will hear; but God does not speak with us, because
LET'S NOT DIE” [^709].

Unless you want to explain this description of what happened in the
Mount Sinai through a volcano, without recognizing, without accepting, DENYING,
the VOICES that enunciated the commandments, and that the story says that EVERYTHING
the people of Israel listened, and therefore DENYING the intervention
directly from the creator, from heaven and earth in the event, is
relatively EASY to accept what has to be the synchronism of the
Biblical place where Mount Sinai or Biblical Mount Horeb is.

For the purposes of this presentation the two contiguous peaks that
have similar characteristics will be referred to by the name
Biblical Horeb.

Mount Sinai or Biblical Horeb is the mountain in Saudi Arabia known
such as Jabal-al-Lawz or Jabal-Maqla.

The logical reasons and evidence that allow this host
assert synchronicity are:

1. Jabal-Maqla is in the area still known today as Midian.
    This is consistent with the biblical narrative that tells us that Moses
    lived in Midian, as the husband of a daughter of a local leader,
    when he sees the burning bush on a mount called Horeb, SAME mount
    the one who later brings all the people of Israel.
2. The area has two mountain peaks that can be seen with the naked eye
    almost black in color consistent with the biblical narrative that
    Horeb's peak was burned by fire when YHWH dictated the
    commandments with a voice of thunder.
3. The name Jabal-Maqla can be translated as “burnt mountain”,
    consistent with the biblical narrative.
4. The granite rocks that make up the Jabal-Maqla dome look
    burned on the side of the surface, presenting a color almost
    black. And they don't seem burned inside or on the side
    internal, presenting a typical color of granite: light yellowish.
5. In the Jabal-Maqla area there are remains of what looks like an altar
    built with uncut stones. This is consistent with the narrative
    Biblical that tells us that Moses built an altar with stones without
    cut.
6. In the Jabal-Maqla area there are several places with inscriptions that
    are not typical of the area, including typically Hebrew drawings
    like bulls and menorahs.
7. An arrangement of large rocks in particular, at the base of
    Jabal-Maqla, and in the middle of a great plain, presents a great quantity
    of drawn bulls. This is consistent with the biblical narrative that
    tells us that the children of Israel built a golden calf
    to worship him at the base of the mountain where they were camping.
8. The access area to Jabal-Maqla is fenced and with restricted passage
    by the government of Saudi Arabia and is considered a place
    archaeological.
9. The arrangement of large rocks with drawings of bulls, which is in the
    base of Jabal-Maqla and in the middle of the plain, is also
    fenced, with passage restricted by the government of Saudi Arabia, and
    It is considered an archaeological site.
10. To the north-west of Jabal-Maqla there is a large rock split in two in
    what appear to be the remains of a water source that flowed from the
    stone. This is consistent with the biblical narrative that God used
    Moses to draw water from a rock at Horeb.
11. Halfway up Jabal-Maqla there is a cave. This is consistent
    with the biblical narrative that tells us that, many years after
    Moses, the prophet Elijah was on Mount Horeb in a cave.
12. Halfway up Jabal-Maqla there is a small plane. This is
    consistent with the biblical narrative that tells us that Moses
    went up with 70 elders of Israel up to a certain point and then left them
    there waiting, along with Aaron and Hur, while he finished climbing
    the mountain with Joshua.
13. Nearby, to what would be the altar that Moses built at the base of
    Horeb, there are remains of marble columns forming a circle. This is
    consistent with the witnesses that Solomon also built a
    small memorial dome on Mount Horeb.
14. The local Bedouins identify the mountain as Jabal-Musa which is
    can be translated as the "mountain of Moses".
15. Ceramic utensils have been found in the area, possibly
    Hebrew This is consistent with the Israelites passing through the
    zone.
16. This synchronism is consistent with the synchronism that the crossing
    of the Red Sea was at Nuweiba. That is to say that both synchronisms are
    they reinforce each other.
17. On a possible route from Nuweiba to Jabal-Maqla there is a place with
    palm trees and 12 wells. This evidence is consistent with the
    Biblical description of Elim. The coordinates of said place are 28
    34 09.90N, 34 49 58.97E.

### Synchronizing Egypt.

When we analyze in this video the 500 years of lag that generated
the synchronism of the champion with the rest of the historical evidence of the
Mediterranean and Middle Eastern, including Biblical and
archaeological, no alternative synchronism was proposed.

Actually the monumental mistake involves mapping
chronological data that DO establish adequate coherence between the
Egyptian evidence and all other historical evidence, including the
Biblical and archaeological.

Today a growing number of Egyptologists accept that it should be done
a revision of the Egyptian chronology, although not all accept that they are
500 years of lag.

This is why more than 6 different proposals have been presented on how
such review should be done. Now it seems that every Egyptologist
revisionist has his own idea of ​​how such a revision should be done.

Your host in this video, that is me Jose Luis Quiroga, based on the
evidence presented by a growing number of scholars on the subject,
considers that the chronological correspondences that best establish a
pattern of biblical historical coherence with Egypt are as follows:

1. The 18th dynasty corresponds to the times of David, Solomon and Rehoboam.
2. The 13th dynasty corresponds to the times of the exodus.
3. The 3rd dynasty corresponds to the times of Joseph son of Isaac.
4. The 1st dynasty corresponds to the times of Abraham.

And more specifically:

1. Thutmosis 1st corresponds to the times of David.
2. Hatshepsut corresponds to the times of Solomon.
3. Thutmose 3rd corresponds to the times of Rehoboam.
4. Neferhotep 1st corresponds to the times of the exodus.
5. Djoser corresponds to the times of Joseph son of Isaac.
6. Menes corresponds to the times Abraham.

The logical reasons and evidence supporting these correspondences
are the following:

1. If the author of the Song of Songs is Solomon, then the
    poetic literature and hymns from the time of Hatshepsut, from the
    dynasty 18, it has to be simultaneous or later because the
    similarity is too much. The Hatshepsut of the 18 must be simultaneous or
    after Solomon.
2. If the author of Psalm 104 is David, then the hymn of the times of the
    pharaoh Akhenaten, of the 18th dynasty, has to be simultaneous or
    later because the similarity is too much. The Akhenaten of the 18
    must be simultaneous or later than David.
3. If the archaeological evidence at Nimrud indicating that a
    contemporary of King Omri of Israel made a reconstruction of
    the city, then Omri would have to be a contemporary of Amenhotep
    3rd, from the 18th dynasty, because there are also a lot of
    Egyptian artifacts from the 18th dynasty in the same stratum of the
    reconstruction. Amenhotep 3rd of 18 must be simultaneous with
    Omri.
4. If Jerusalem only acquired that name until the time of David,
    then the Amarna letters, from the 18th dynasty, have to be
    simultaneous or subsequent to David because they use that name. The
    Amarna of the 18 must be simultaneous or subsequent to David.
5. If the city of Shechem was actually built by Jeroboam, then the
    Amarna letters, from the 18th dynasty, have to be simultaneous or
    after Jeroboam because they refer to that city. The
    Amarna of the 18th must be concurrent with or subsequent to Jeroboam.
6. The stories of Abdi-Hiba of Jerusalem in the Amarna letters, from
    the 18th dynasty, and the Biblical King Jehoram of Judah are almost identical.
    Both suffered revolts from their territories from Philistia to
    Edom. In both stories the Philistines plunder the king's palace
    with "men of the land of Kasi" or "men close to the
    Kushites”. This is evidence in favor of synchronism and therefore
    evidence in favor of the 18th dynasty extending to times of
    Joram of Judah. The Abdi-Hiba in the Amarna must be Joram.
7. If the vocabulary, grammar, syntax, meter, use of
    parallelisms, the idiomatic uses of the Psalms, as well as some
    stories from the books of Kings are really original from the
    old testament, then some texts from Ugarit on the tablets
    of Ras Shamra from the same period as the Amarna letters have to be
    simultaneous or subsequent to the biblical texts. The Amarna must
    be later than the Psalms.
8. Pottery from the Greek Mycenaean period found at Amarna indicates
    that the Greek Mycenaean period is contemporary with the 18th dynasty and
    the rest of the Mycenaean pottery, which the Greeks traded in
    throughout the Mediterranean, places the Mycenaean period between 1000 and
    750 before Jesus Christ. The Mycenaean Greeks and the 18 must be
    between 1000 and 750 BC.
9. On the Italian peninsula, in Sicily, in Greece, in Malta, in Troy,
    in Anatolia, in Palestine, in Sardinia, in the Aeolian Islands, and others
    archaeological sites of the mediterranean the evidence in ceramics,
    bronze, ivory, and other archaeological artifacts indicate a
    Temporal continuity in Late Bronze strata 2 and 3
    corresponding to the Mycenaean culture. The 18 must be between the
    1000 and 750 before Jesus Christ.
10. All the archaeological evidence of the Greeks agrees with the
    archaeological evidence of the Assyrians. Both coincide with
    biblical evidence. All place the late bronze age 2 and 3
    between 1000 and 750 BC. 3 different systems
    consistent chronological data place the Egyptian 18th dynasty between
    1000 and 750 BC. The 18 must be among the 1000
    and 750 before Jesus Christ.
11. In particular, the ceramics of the immediate archaeological strata
    7b and 8 in Troy indicate a temporal continuity between both
    strata. The pottery from layer 8 at Troy is of the same type as
    the one found in Amarna from the 18th dynasty. House number 814 of the
    Stratum 7b is from the Late Bronze Age. The 18 must be between the
    1000 and 750 before Jesus Christ.
12. In particular, the Hittite cavalry depicted in the tomb of Horemheb
    of the 18th dynasty, and by Seti 1st of the 19th dynasty in his space in
    Karnak, presents the same type of characteristics of the cavalry
    Assyria from the years between 1000 and 750 BC.
    Evidence suggesting that these two neighbors never knew about
    mutual advances in cavalry, or what is much more
    feasible: the 18th and the beginning of the 19th are between 1000 and
    750 before Jesus Christ.
13. The palace found in layer 8 at Megiddo that places it in the
    Late Bronze Ages 2 and 3 is evidence indicating that said
    palace was that of Solomon because said palace corresponds to the
    Biblical description of Solomon's palace. Solomon must have lived in
    Late Bronze Ages 2 and 3.
14. The ivory artifacts found in the stratum 8 palace in
    Megiddo are evidence indicating that said palace belonged to Solomon
    because the figures found in said artifacts are consistent
    with the biblical narrative of the relationship between Egypt and Israel in
    Solomon's times. Solomon must have lived in ages 2 and 3 of the
    late bronze.
15. The fortified constructions of the 2nd and 3rd Bronze Age
    found at Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer have entries of 6
    chambers in the same type of stone indicating a central government
    from north to south, evidence that is consistent with the
    biblical narrative that tells us that Solomon built on these three
    cities. Solomon must have lived in Late Bronze Ages 2 and 3.
16. The seal of Tuthmosis 3rd found in stratum 7b at Megiddo,
    after the palace of layer 8, is evidence that indicates that
    Thutmosis 3rd is the biblical Shishak and therefore the 18th dynasty
    Egyptian with Tutmosis 3rd is simultaneous with the biblical King Rehoboam. The
    Thutmosis 3rd of 18 must be Shishak.
17. One of the biblical ways of referring to the queen of Shaba is
    also queen of the south. Evidence in favor of synchronism that
    Hatshepsut is the queen of Shaba. The Hatshepsut of the 18 must be the
    queen of shaba
18. A possible pronunciation of Thebes, the Egyptian city from which
    Hatshepsut reigned over Egypt, it is Shebas. Word of local origin that
    en means “wild cat”, which is consistent with sphinxes
    with body shape of "wild cat". The Hatshepsut of the 18 must
    to be the queen of Shaba.
19. The queen of Shaba, according to biblical evidence, must refer to
    an important reign, not a secondary ruler. The Hatshepsut
    of the 18 must be the queen of Shaba.
20. The historian Josephus identified the queen of Shaba as “The queen
    of Egypt and Ethiopia", where Ethiopia in the context of Josephus is
    refers to the area of ​​Nubia, not to present-day Ethiopia. The Hatshepsut of
    the 18 must be the queen of Shaba.
21. The names of the characters in the story of the queen of Shaba,
    according to Abyssinian tradition, they have great textual similarities
    with the Egyptian names of Hatshepsut and Thutmose 3rd. the name in
    Hatshepsut's throne was Makeda and the Abyssinian tradition
    identified as Makeda. In Phoenician both letters are quite similar.
    In this tradition Solomon is the father of the son of the queen of
    Shaba, who then plunders Solomon's temple, the same as
    Thutmose 3rd. The Hatshepsut of the 18 must be the queen of Shaba.
22. The fact that during the reign of David and Solomon they did not succeed
    wars with Egypt corresponds to what we know of the times
    Tuthmosis 1st, father of Hatshepsut. Tuthmosis 1st of the 18 must
    be the pharaoh in the time of David.
23. The journey to Punt in Hatshepsut's temple is represented with
    great detail right in front of his birth. This indicates that Punt
    it was an important kingdom and not a secondary one. The Point of the 18
    It must be an important kingdom.
24. Thutmose 3rd conquered Punt during his 1st campaign. evidence that
    indicates that Punt was in the same area as all the cities and
    territories visited in said campaign and discard any place
    far from these territories. The Punt of the 18 should be Israel.
25. All the evidence from the first campaign of Thutmose 3rd indicates that
    the conquered territory corresponds to the southern part of Israel
    current. Evidence indicating that Hatshepsut's journey was to said
    territory. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.
26. Evidence at Hatshepsut's temple indicates that Punt was
    identified as “Ta-Netjer” or “Land of God”. “Ta-Netjer” in the
    Egyptian culture, through multiple inscriptions, this
    directly related to Osiris and the city Byblos in the
    current Lebanon. Evidence indicating that Punt was sacred territory
    for the Egyptians and that therefore the journey to Punt was of utmost
    importance that Hatshepsut's presence required for her
    political interests. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.
27. Egyptian records indicate that they considered their origin
    era of Punt and archaeological evidence indicates that the Egyptians
    They are of Phoenician origin. Evidence that is consistent with locating
    Punt in the Israel of Solomon. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.
28. The Phoenicians considered that the Egyptians had their origin in their
    land. Evidence that is consistent with placing Punt in the Israel
    of Solomon. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.
29. Archaeologically, during the 18th dynasty great development is observed
    in the area of ​​Israel, and on the contrary, only cultures
    primitives in the other places presented as candidates to be
    Punt by Egyptologists. Evidence in favor of the toponym that Punt
    remains in the Israel of Solomon. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.
30. Numerous Egyptian inscriptions relate Punt to the city
    Byblos, and the Egyptian goddess Hathor with Byblos, also called
    "Lady of Byblos" and "Lady of Punt". Evidence in favor of
    toponym that Punt remains in Solomon's Israel. the journey of
    Hatshepsut went to Israel.
31. Biblical and extra-biblical evidence indicates that Solomon's Israel
    It was the most outstanding kingdom in plant and animal variety,
    especially in the Jordan Valley area, as well as in
    abundance of gold and silver, especially in Jerusalem, among all
    the important cultures of that time, including Egypt itself,
    the rest of Africa and the Eastern peoples. Hatshepsut's journey
    went to Israel.
32. The coincidence in material, number and class of artifacts between the
    Biblical record of looting in Solomon's temple by Shishak
    and the record in the section of Thutmose 3rd in the Karnak complex
    is evidence in favor of synchronism that Thutmose 3rd is the
    Biblical shishak. Thutmosis 3rd of 18 must be Shishak.
33. The name Kadesh means Holy in Hebrew. Even currently at
    Jerusalem is known as the Holy City. This coincidence is
    evidence in favor of toponym that Kadesh is Jerusalem in the
    Thutmose 3rd campaign of conquest to the southern territory of Israel of
    Solomon. Thutmosis 3rd of 18 must be Shishak.
34. Read the narration of the Ipuur papyrus about the fall of the 13th dynasty
    It's like reading the biblical exodus. The similarities are in everything: the
    plagues, the Egyptian magicians, the deaths, the lamentations, the fall of
    Egypt. It is basically the Egyptian record of the exodus. This is
    evidence that the exodus happens at the time of the 13th dynasty.
    exodus must have happened on the 13th.
35. All the support already presented for the synchronism that Jose is
    Imhotep reinforces the correspondence that the biblical Joseph lived in
    times of Djoser is the pharaoh of Egypt of the 3rd dynasty and is
    consistent with the rest of the correspondences presented now.

Thus, the correspondences of that:

1. The 18th dynasty corresponds to the times of David, Solomon and Rehoboam.
2. The 13th dynasty corresponds to the times of the exodus.
3. The 3rd dynasty corresponds to the times of Joseph son of Isaac.
4. The 1st dynasty corresponds to the times of Abraham.

And more specifically that:

1. Tutmosis 1st corresponds to the times of David
2. Hatshepsut corresponds to the times of Solomon.
3. Thutmose 3rd corresponds to the times of Rehoboam.
4. Neferhotep 1st corresponds to the times of the exodus.
5. Djoser corresponds to the times of Joseph son of Isaac.
6. Menes corresponds to the times Abraham.

They are the correspondences that allow establishing an Egyptian chronology
that does not generate archaeological jumps of 400 and 500 years in other cultures,
and a logical coherence between the chronology of Egypt and the other three
chronologies that are already consistent with each other: the Assyrian, the Greek and the
biblical

### Probability.

#### Fundamental probability.

Question 1:

Consider an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle. Suppose it is
choose a chord of the circle. What is the probability that the rope
longer than one side of the triangle?

Question 2.

There is a certain amount of liquid. Everything we know about the liquid
is that it is composed entirely of wine and water, and that the proportion
of wine to water is between 1/3 and 3. What is the probability that the
ratio of wine to water is less than or equal to 2?

Question 1 is known in probability by the name of "the
Bertrand paradox. A French namesake of this host because the
Bertrand's proper name is Joseph Louis.

Question 2 is known as the “water and moon paradox”.
came from Ludwig Von Mises," a Jew born in the territory of present-day
Ukraine that had to run to the United States.

These two questions are not really paradoxical at all, just
point out the impossibility of generically applying what is known in
fundamental probability as “the principle of indifference”.

To the first question formulated in 1889 they have tried to find
solutions, that is, they have tried to remove it, in various
ways. To the second question they simply have not been able to give
answer, that is to say that they have not been able to remove him. The last
attempt was in 2004.

All these attempts fail because they try to answer the questions
as such and not the point they seek to make.

The point is that there is NO so-called "fair coin", a coin 0.5 and
0.5 that which was already discussed in this video. All REAL currency is
loaded to one side and every coin that can be described with a
ALGORITHM is pseudo-random.

In the case of fundamental probabilities, those that are based on the
principle of indifference, these probabilities depend, eye DEPEND,
of the way to choose that which supposedly has a distribution
random in an “indifferent” way, between quotation marks.

To really try to describe a behavior with probabilities
It is necessary to determine, define, establish the function of
selection, the one they call random, the one that will never really be
really random but pseudo-random, i.e. quasi-random,
because such a "fair currency" does not exist.

In the case of fundamental probability, to be able to say that it
describes the functioning of a system, we must define the function
HUMP, the random function. It is necessary to know the operation of the
selection function. Thus, said “indifference”, in quotes, of the
supposed "principle of indifference", of all probability theory
fundamental only exists in cases where such a function is known. Do not
it can be assumed that I know it, it must be effectively defined or
know her.

#### Statistical probability.

Probability theories are born with card and dice games.
They seek to try to predict an event from past events,
assigning a value to the possibility of it happening.

In statistical probability, probability is understood as what
it really is: a simple relative frequency. I take my real currency, the
I toss a million times and count how many times it came up heads, how many times
seal came out, and how many times was it standing on the edge. Then with those
counts I calculate the frequency of each possibility, and thus determine the
probability that my next toss will come up with each possibility.

Thus, that such "relative" of any frequency is always determined by
prior knowledge of the problem. This knowledge is used to
establish functional RELATIONSHIPS between the variables of the problem to
study. That prior knowledge is defined in terms of functions
math.

In statistics it is used is the partial knowledge that we have of the
operation of the system to try to predict a future event. I know
assumes, or is intended, or effectively unknown, the operation
complete system.

These types of theories are used in all types of systems where only
has a PARTIAL knowledge of the global system, of that which includes
subsystems that I do know, and can control, and others that I don't.

When my creation, that part of the system that I can describe
deterministically, that part that I can control, has to
interact with what I do not know, I seek to try, eye TRY, to predict
how will that interaction be, in a probabilistic way. That's why in
this type of creations, which interact with external systems whose
operation is unknown, such interaction sometimes works already
sometimes not

#### Creations.

It serves no one to have a chance that the parts of their creation
whether or not they are in the place where they should be, and it is no use for anyone to have
a probability that the parts of your creation will or will not have the
speed they must have for the creation to work.

It is no use to anyone that the parts of their machinery may be where
they should be and maybe if they do what they should do. they cannot be
build MACHINES in terms of what is known only one probability
that its parts ARE, and DO move, do have the speed, the
momentum, or NOT, that they must have.

Probability theories are completely useless to create something
because they are not deterministic systems. They only serve to try
TO DESCRIBE a CREATION, once created, as if it had no CREATOR, is
say pretending NOT to know the deterministic model that describes said
creation. They serve only to analyze a creation pretending, or
Assuming that its operation is unknown. Pretend to use a theory
of probability to explain the fundamental functioning of a
creation is simply to deny its CREATOR.

#### Quantum.

Every quantum ideology is, in its mathematical aspect, a theory of
probability. They seek to calculate the probability that one, misnamed,
“elementary particle” has a position, a velocity, or a momentum
dice.

In the case of fundamental quantum ideologies, the same problem
presenting the theories of fundamental probability is applied. That
supposed "principle of indifference" is false. The "fair" currency
exists. We must define the random function in each case. It can not
apply to try to explain the fundamental functioning of the
matter. Assuming the supposed "principle of indifference", in quotes,
It is a fundamental error from the point of view strictly
mathematical.

And in the case of quantum ideologies that use probability
statistically, the problem, at least from the point of view of
criterion of technical creativity, is that they are not useful. do not qualify as
science because they are not deterministic, they are not used to build an object
from what they study: supposed elementary particles.

Statistics is used to analyze events of created objects, not to
create the objects. For this, deterministic models are needed. Can
predict what the pieces of my creation are going to do at each moment to
let my creation do what it's supposed to do.

#### Popular.

I don't know if the idea is clear to you but what this means is that the
lovers of popular quantum ideologies, those who still use
predictive statistics systems, or even worse probability systems
based on the supposed “principle of indifference”, to try to
explain, at the point of probabilities, the behavior of some supposed
elementary particles, those lovers, what they really need is
a deterministic explanation about the behavior of the supposed
elementary particles so that in this way the explanation does serve
to build something with the supposed elementary particles.

Perhaps they should begin to consider that the supposed particles
elementals, neither are they particles, nor are they elementals. what they really are
stationary electromagnetic waves traveling in a medium
which has been denied its existence since the end of the
19th century, when two of the most popular ideologies appear today:
quantum in terms of probability and gravity in terms of
curvature.

In the 19th century, to a "genius", in quotes, whom the Satan, the
enemy, he put in the first person, the "great idea", in quotes,
to ASSUME that the speed of light is always the same in space
empty, which is yet to be found, and postulates it as an AXIOM, that is,
that is ASSUMED and must be EVIDENT for anyone, of their ideology, wrong
called theory of gravity. Not realizing that the supposed
axiom, nothing obvious to ANYONE, makes it mathematically reducible to
ABSURD.

However, the MEDIUM in which electromagnetic waves travel
has always been there with the name of "electromagnetic field", so
want to call it MEDIUM, as they did in the 19th century before
the absurd ideology of gravity appeared thanks to its “obvious”,
in quotes, “AXIOM”, in quotes, which ASSUMES that the speed of
the light is always the same in an empty space that is still
meet.

Some even claim that the ideologue of the absurd ideology thought
that said MIDDLE had to exist because otherwise the second
version of its ABSURD ideology, based on the same AXIOM, would make it
ABSURD. Apparently the "genius", in quotes, never realized that
its AXIOM already made it mathematically reducible to the ABSURD.

Sad, right? But here we are, two quite popular ideologies, one
scientifically absurd, the other not only that but also
mathematically absurd, and both that dial theories SCIENTIFICALLY
proven, the encyclopedia says so and the majority believes it.

### Seriously absurd.

At the end of the 19th century, outer space was believed to be empty. A
late 19th century, planetary motion was explained in terms
of a mathematical model that only depended on an attractive force. An
predictive model but obviously without creative force. not even now
we can make planets, and if the bible is true we will not be able to, for
at least not before the resurrection of the dead.

At the end of the 19th century there were no satellites in orbit, there were no
television, there were no airplanes, there were no orbiting telescopes, no
there were no computers, there were no interoceanic optical networks, there were no
transistors, there were no microcircuits, there was no Internet, there were no
cell phones. At the end of the 19th century mathematics had to be done by
HAND, and if a process was too complex to model with
linear equations, it was impossible to solve the equations in almost
All cases.

In that context a German Jew who liked to stick out his tongue was
It so happened that the entire universe could be described in terms of a
attractive force and ONLY attractive, that is to say that it can only attract,
known as gravity. In their THOUGHT experiments, since they did not
could do in practice, decided that an axiom, that which must be
obvious to anyone, of his descriptive theory, because it only serves
for that, was that the speed of light is always the same in a
empty space, because outer space was believed to be empty.
Obviously he chose as a mathematical model something that was fashionable
such as tensor theory, an algebraic model that allows to work
vectors and scalars in virtually any form the user likes.
Of the will.

He stuck out his tongue and thought: "We have a three-dimensional space, that is to say
vector, a scalar time, and we can use tensors to work the
two as if it were a 4-dimensional mathematical space and that's it!
Let us describe the universe. That one that at the end of the 19th century did not leave the
galaxy and it only had about 300 thousand stars.

As the first theory did not come out so general, then he got the general one.
They also had the attraction that since they were described with equations NOT
linear, NOBODY at that time could solve them for the general case.
Let's remember that math had to be done by HAND.

The equations also had another attraction: they could be inserted and removed.
taste factors. In the beginning he decided that it would be nice to have a universe
stable and he put his factor, that sum or little multiplication that one
he got into school when the equations didn't add up. that what
some call MACHETAZO. When later it occurred to another guy that
the famous red shift, which we already talked about in this video,
meant an expanding universe, decided it had been a mistake and
he took it off. They were adaptable. Very practical to describe a universe
of 4 dimensions where one is time. Gravity is just
curvature of that imaginary space that exists only in the mind of
those who study the theory of genius this.

They also had some pretty interesting consequences. According to theory, if
we put a clock on earth and another on a spaceship, let's remember
that the genius could only do experiments on the mind, and the ship leaves
traveling through space and then back to earth, the clock on the ship
will mark a shorter time for the trip than what the clock says in
the earth. Interesting, right?. Only it also has other consequences.
According to the theory, the ship can ALSO tell that it is the earth that
is making the trip and from the point of view of the ship it is the clock
on earth which will mark a shorter time for the journey than what
mark the clock on the ship. Which allows us to conclude that according to the
Theoretically, a clock can be faster and slower for the same event.
than another watch. Little mathematical contradictions that make it
even more interesting. ABSURD but interesting. The world loved it and
it still does.

When the EXCLUSIVELY attractive force on which your
description of the universe, that of the late 19th century, was not enough
to explain the characteristics of what began to be observed in the
20th century, the solution was more factors. purely mathematical factors.
Factors that do not correspond to any observable physical reality.

Why don't galaxies dissolve? Why do they have structure? For
that move as we observe that they move? How could they get to
form? Easy, put a factor in that pod. Dark matter. dark
because we can't see it. But you have to say yes because if you don't
I finished my little work in theory. That it touches that it is more than 80% of the
total matter to make it fit. DOES NOT MATTER. Put that pod on him. A
submits more than 80% of something that, BY DEFINITION, is not observed by
nowhere.

Then more questions appeared and it was time to answer them at the tip of more
factors. Factors that even the encyclopedia recognizes as MORE
HYPOTHETICAL. Eye, MORE! Listen well: MORE!. Dark energy appeared
black holes, and others. Isn't there enough power to
explain my universe of only attractive forces as I want it to be?
Put dark energy in it. I can not explain with my model, of only forces
attractive, the distribution of energy in galaxies? put holes in it
blacks. ALL black and dark because, BY DEFINITION, they cannot be
look nowhere. They only exist in mathematics so that
fit, that is, in the imagination of those who earn money for studying
that which cannot be observed, but it must be said that yes, that
indirectly, that with great care, that the evidence is there, that
only experts in the theory understand it, which blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah.

But more questions came up. Did currents and fields appear
electromagnetic waves that fill all that I thought was empty space?
Call it something else and adapt those equations again because it starts
to look more and more like a universe explainable with theory
electromagnetic, the one that does consider the existence of forces
REPULSIVE, a plasma universe, and not the one I thought it was.
Did higher velocities appear than we had assumed as
maximum for electromagnetic waves? Simply DENY it outright and
keep your false axiomatic postulate, which was not evident to anyone,
because it is an axiom of the theory and that little part was not adaptable.

Amazing, right? But that's how we are. The encyclopedia calls it science and
believe the majority.

### Fields.

Man has developed many fields of study.

Everything begins with the observation of a phenomenon, whatever its
interest of human consciousness, then seeks to measure, analyze,
study the phenomenon, and in most cases, reproduce, repeat
The phenomenon. Then formulate a series of hypotheses, a model, a
operation scheme of the observed phenomenon. Based on said
model, experiments are made with the phenomenon, to try to verify
if the things that my model predicts will happen actually happen. In
the extent to which the predictions are successful the model actually
works and explains the observed phenomenon. To this cycle and its variants
They are known as scientific methods.

The criterion normally used to determine whether a model or
theory is really scientific or not, is that the hypotheses in which
based on the model, or theory, are falsifiable. falsifiable means
that experiments that test hypotheses can be
negative or contrary to what I expected to happen.

The criterion raised in this video requires one more step. not required
only understand, or believe that it is understood, through a model or theory,
mathematical or not, which has been verified, or proven, by
repeated observation that the predictions it makes about the phenomenon
are met. The criteria in this video require not only verifying the
model, or believe that it has been verified, but to create something new, to build
something new, that is useful, usable, by the human being, an object. Something that
allows the human being who does not know the theory, who knows the
mathematical details or not, check that the theory or model is useful
For something. Was the model needed to create something useful? if the answer
is affirmative, the model begins to be validated according to the criteria of the
technical creativity, the criterion of this video.

This condition implies that the object product of the knowledge of a
phenomenon is reproducible, repeatable. That the object of study can be
recreate. Do you study electric fields? This step involves being able to recreate them
to taste. Do you study magnetic fields? This step involves power
reproduce them. Do you study the behavior of stars? Fields of
gravity? Galaxies? elementary particles? biological cells? East
step implies being able to recreate them, reproduce them, repeat them to taste
starting from the generative or constitutive elements that explain the
model or theory to verify.

This step is not just to replicate the phenomenon, but to build something new out of it.
from its objects of study, something useful and usable by the human being.
Do you study electromagnetic fields and built a transmitting object and a
receiving object of electromagnetic waves to transmit messages
remote humans? Qualify. Do you study elementary particles but not
builds them or builds anything new with them that is useful to the being
human? DOES NOT QUALIFY. It is a field of study but it is not a science, a
true knowledge.

Mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics, dynamics, acoustics,
organic and inorganic chemistry, aeronautics, all engineering that
build objects: civil, chemical, electrical, mechanical, metallurgical,
materials, computational, medical etc. qualify according to this criteria
because they have allowed to build airplanes, shoes, cell phones,
microscopes, telephones, watches, televisions, hammers, trains,
telescopes, computers, pots, buildings, transistors, automobiles,
satellites, refrigerators, washers, polishers, backhoes, machines that
they make machines, factories that use machines made by other factories
to build other OBJECTS.

No field of study in biology, botany, ecology,
in medicine, in zoology, in genetics, not even in astronomy,
geology, oceanography, and much of physics, such as nuclear,
quantum science, and cosmology, do not qualify by this criterion either. Are
fields of study, but they do not qualify as true knowledge, as
true science, according to the criterion of technical creativity.

No model or theory that seeks to explain cell-based systems
qualifies because man has not been able to build a cell, nor
reproduce from cells a system of cells, plants,
animals or humans. However, they DO qualify all theories
necessary to build the INSTRUMENTS or OBJECTS used in those
study fields. For example, optics were necessary to build the
first microscope. Qualify.

Neither do purely abstract theories qualify, no theory
purely mathematical qualifies, because despite being necessary for
explain virtually any modern model or theory that
qualify, the objects created by such models or theories are not
concrete, they are not physical, they are not perceivable through
senses.

### Aliens.

The word "terrestrial" is normally defined as anything that has
origin on this earth, on this planet. So EXTRA-terrestrial is everything
that which has no origin on this planet.

Then it can be concluded that, according to what the Bible teaches, neither the Father,
neither the Son Jesus Christ, nor the Holy Spirit, nor the angels, nor Satan
and company, nor the Cherubim, nor any heavenly principality or power
It is of terrestrial origin. They are all EXTRA-terrestrial because their origin is NOT
It's from this planet.

The idea of ​​life forms external to this planet seems to start in the
2nd century after Jesus Christ in the fictional book entitled "History
True” by Luciano, where the Sun and the Moon seem to be the only
astronomical objects capable of hosting life forms.

However, there is the issue of Unidentified Flying Objects, in
Spanish normally known as OVNIs or also as UFOs for their
English acronym.

The first "flying saucers" are observed in the 1940s.
A little later, in 1947, the acronym OVNI began to be used in Spanish.
and UFO in English. And a few years later the word “alien” appears
in dictionaries for the use that has been given to it in novels of the
which is now known as science fiction.

In the year 2014, facing the Dead Sea with the sun almost at its zenith,
without a cloud in sight, with a completely blue sky, on a trip in
group made with the San John Crisóstomo Parish of Bogotá, three
people, among whom I include myself, Jose Luis Quiroga, we saw what
which can be called an unidentified flying object, a UFO.

The event that I personally observed lasted no more than a tenth of a
second, if I had blinked at that moment I wouldn't have seen it.
Looking from west to east, towards the Dead Sea, with the Sun
at 95 degrees from the horizon, a light, as bright as the sun, as
at 70 degrees from the horizon, the size of a star, but
obviously within the atmosphere since it was visible on a day without
no cloud and with a completely blue sky, the light stretched like a
laser beam style line, from west to east, until
about 20 degrees from horizontal, and then the line of light
He disappeared. Kind of like the effect they do in the movie Trip to
the stars with the spaceship, but a single point of light that
stretches until it forms a line of light that then disappears.

I don't think it was a star, I don't think it was an optical effect, no
I think it was something astronomical. I think it was an object built by
the human being with technology that has been hidden since he was
Invented during World War II.

For me it was nothing more than a confirmation of my personal research in
the issue of unidentified flying objects, more specifically on
“flying saucers”, which he had made in the early 1990s
2000, thanks to the Internet network.

My interest in the subject of unidentified flying objects begins
after reading several of the books that purport to explain the
resurrection of Jesus Christ as an event directed or organized by
aliens Extraterrestrials that are not biblical, it is not about the
creator of heaven and earth, but of a supposed civilization that
it has its origin in another part of the heaven of heavens. But if
Jesus Christ was indeed resurrected, the rest of the bible, not just the
part that speaks of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, has to be true,
and if that is so, then the hypothesis that a civilization
coming from those lights that we see in the sky, and that we call
stars, was the one that resurrected Jesus Christ has to be false. The
hypothesis may be consistent with a small part of the gospels
but it is not with respect to the whole bible.

The scientific theory behind the development of this technology
is none other than the old and well-known "electromagnetic theory" of Maxwell
and Heaviside, the same one behind most of the technologies
20th and 21st century. Nothing unusual.

Since 1911 Nikola Tesla, the inventor of various types of motor and of the
mechanisms of transmission of electrical energy in the form of current
alternates that are still used all over the planet today, a practitioner of the
electromagnetic theory of Maxwell and Heaviside, declared in newspapers
such as "The Sun" and the "Herald" of New York, about his design of a
flying machine without planes, without wings, or propellers, shaped like a box, which
it can stay static in the air, which is not affected by the wind,
which can also reach speeds above the speed of the
sound, because, he claims, he has worked out a dynamical theory of
gravity that will put an end to vain speculations and false conceptions,
like that of curved space.

In the mid-20th century, Thomas Townsend Brown worked on projects for
the United States Navy in a field of study known in English
as electrogravitics, which is nothing other than the well-known theory of
classical fields, which relates magnetism and electricity, the theory
electromagnetic field, but applied to similarly relate the
gravity and electricity.

It is really not so difficult to imagine the mechanism of electropropulsion
used in early models of a wingless flying machine or
propellers, if one takes into account that the potential difference between the
atmosphere and the earth is about 400 thousand volts. I only know
you need to charge a capacitor with voltages higher than that difference and
be able to alter said load to taste. This capacitor will move between
the earth and the atmosphere depending on the amount of charge it has
stored. The movement is controlled by changing the distribution of the
charge on the capacitor, similarly to as a particle, whose
electric charge is changing, it is displaced within a field
electric. Where in this case, the electric field is given by that
potential difference between the earth and the atmosphere of 400 thousand
volts.

Early models achieved this effect by charging the capacitor with
asymmetric voltage pulses, where the voltage change is faster
on the rise than on the fall, where the maximum voltage of said pulses
is less than 50 thousand volts. The result is that charge is pumped into the
capacitor by applying said pulses with a frequency higher than the
rate at which the capacitor can be discharged to the charge
in the capacitor, and to quickly discharge it, reverse the
asymmetry in the voltage pulses. Asymmetry in high pulses
voltage and high frequency allow to charge and discharge the capacitor. There is
several patents from the last century, from the 20th century, that describe this
propulsion mechanism used since the second world war.

But the development of this technology continued and with the advent of
digital information and its encryption mechanisms, the track
of such development is lost by the end of the 20th century. Only the
testimonies of groups of people who have seen ships, the result of
said technology, or its variants, which can reach sizes
gigantic, and they have different forms to the flying saucer of
1947.

One of the most documented sightings of gigantic UFOs are the
“Phoenix Lights”, in 1997, in Arizona. The development of ships like the
observed in Phoenix is ​​financed by the billions of
dollars diverted from innocuous large public projects like the
particle accelerators and so-called research projects in
nuclear fusion reactors around the planet. I don't know for this
they need more than 100 thousand people organized in the form of a para-government,
people from a subset of the planetary military industrial complex,
influenced by Satan and company, with the same greed that
affect man since the time of Adam: money, social power and pleasure.
About 100 thousand greedy in control of some technologies developed in
secret since the second world war and that they are almost “vox-populi”.

My speculation about the future, movie style, is that when
the event of the rapture of the chosen ones by the creator God happens
of Heaven and Earth, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,
analyzed in this video, when the return of Jesus Christ begins, and
those who will continue on this planet are temporarily raptured
to heaven, while the rest, those who stayed on earth, kill themselves
each other for survival, the one they think you have to fight for
because they believe that death is the end, while they kill each other,
I repeat, on a planet that suffers the planetary effects initiated in
times of Noah, earthquakes, wars, pandemics, overpopulation, change
climate, lack of drinking water, lack of food, and the absence
of the Holy Spirit in their minds and hearts that makes them believe that the
death is the end, when said rapture is carried out by the
God you don't need star travel style ships to travel to
the stars, at that time, Satan and company will use these
greedy to make those who stayed believe that the
aliens took the chosen ones in a mass abduction.

The aliens took them. A half truth if we have in
realize that neither our heavenly Father, nor Jesus Christ, nor the Holy Spirit
Saint, nor do the angels originate on this planet and are therefore
aliens Only the so-called good guys will be these greedy and
they will make the pantomime of descending like heroes, with their flotilla of ships, to
defend the human race from the evil ones who took a part of
mankind, causing the world wars announced in the book of
the revelation.

You already know the outcome of the movie if you paid attention to the video
when the book of Revelation and the Return of the Son of the
Man, of our Lord Jesus Christ.

### Determinism.

The determinism that is accepted in this video is the same that is accepted in
any process that allows technical creativity. This means
that said determinism is limited by the capacity of the
creator or user of a technology in predicting or determining the
behavior of the created.

In the creative processes of the human being there is always a list of
variables that have to be kept within limits for the
creation works. temperature, pressure, speed, force, area,
volume, time, voltage etc. are some of the variables that limit
the working of a creation. A commercial cell phone does not work
5000 degrees centigrade or without battery. temperature and voltage
limit determinism, behavior determined by the logic of
creation, in this case a commercial cell phone.

Determinism, that ability to determine the functioning, the
operation of all creation is limited by the capacity of the PERSON
who exercises it. Determinism is something that is exercised by a PERSON
in the context of a creation, of something created.

In the case of heaven and earth, it is our creator, the creator of the
heaven and earth, who establishes and knows said determinism, and very
limitedly the human being as a user of said creation. So what
to the human being it may seem completely indeterminate, as for
example the future, for our creator no.

This conceptual position, in which determinism is a function of
capacities of each PERSON that interacts with a CREATION, it is
different from the most popular conceptual positions. This concept does not
depends only on some material causes, or on a logic, or on a
structure, or of a generative process, much less of a
statistics, but of the people who have the capacity to determine
something. It is dependent on the PERSON that interacts with a CREATION. Yes
there is no creation there is no determinism. If there is no person there is no
determinism.

In the case of the human being, a creature with the ability to create,
presents the case of the acquisition of such determinism. the human being
can learn to reproduce, create, alter, manipulate, predict something
over what someone else has created. The person can acquire determinism
about a CREATION. The person can acquire a TRUTH about a
creation. That process in the capacity of the human being to alter,
manipulate, predict a behavior of something created, either by the
man or by our creator, alters the determinism of said being
human.

An example is a month-old baby and his mother. A baby can determine,
within his abilities, where he moves his little arm but cannot
determine the room in which you will sleep tonight. Mother
you can determine, within your capabilities, in which room you will sleep
your baby tonight. And God can determine, within his capabilities,
whether or not the baby is going to sleep in a room tonight.

Determinism is limited by the capabilities of each PERSON
Regarding a CREATION, it is a function of the PERSON and of the CREATED.

Thus, for the Creator of Heaven and Earth, the future of Heaven and Earth
the Earth are completely determined, established, planned
From the beginning. All men, women, old people and children, even
those of breast that have died or are going to die, are perfectly
determined to die the moment they did or will. Y
according to the words of Jesus Christ everyone, absolutely everyone, will be
resurrected, both those who did good and those who did evil
evil. Including those of Amalek who were killed by Saul following
YHWH's orders. All evil is used for good by our Father
heavenly. It's all part of his plan. The rebellion of Satan and company,
Saul's disobedience, the disobedience of all humanity and the
death of Jesus Christ on the Cross for the sins of you, me and the whole
humanity, as well as his resurrection on the 3rd day. It's exactly why
that God is God and left everything written before. he he knows the end
From the beginning.

PART 4. TESTIMONY.
=====================================

My testimony.
-----------------------------

I think my process so far can be summed up in 4 different stages.

1. Conclude that there must be a superior being.
2. Believe that Jesus Christ was physically resurrected.
3. Believe that the entire Bible must be true.
4. Begin to follow Jesus Christ.

The first three stages were a purely intellectual process. From
study of the bible, of the evidence in favor, of the logic that unites them.
This video is the summary of the topics that God put me to study for
come to believe what I believe.

Coming to believe in the existence of a superior being takes me since the year
1980 to 1991 approximately. But he was not the creator
we read in the bible, it was simply a force, a universal energy and
aware. Getting to believe that Jesus Christ is risen takes me since 1997
until 2003. And coming to believe that the bible is true takes me until
mid 2009. Those were the times that God used in my case.

However, believing in a Creator God, in Jesus Christ and that the Bible is
true, it does not imply following Jesus Christ. That fourth stage only began
until January 2017.

I graduated as a computer and systems engineer in 1993. Since
year 1998, I dedicate my professional knowledge to search, in a
independent, a practical solution to the well-known mathematical problem
like the SAT problem, the satisfiability problem. In 2010,
I come to the conclusion that the last strategy, which I had taken
more than a year and a half to implement, it is equivalent to all those that had
failed during more than 10 years of innocuous efforts. During those more
of 10 years of innocuous efforts the economic sustenance for that routine,
that I have in a room where I sleep and work, comes
Mainly from my parents. The same day that I discover bliss
equivalence, and thus the fundamental reason for my latest failure,
while my parents are away on a weekend trip, i cry
in my room on Friday night and ask that Jesus Christ for help in
the one that I already believe, but that really is not a fundamental part of me
existence. The next day, Saturday morning, I start to think
in what would be the ideal conditions that would allow a strategy
effective and I come up with a new strategy in which I start to
work that same day and that I finally finished implementing it in the
year 2016.

The software project is free software under the name of
"Ben-Jose Trainable SAT Solver" on the developer portal
"github.com" since 2014, the year I traveled to Israel, financed
largely because of my mother. When I finish, in 2016, I prepare
a document that I send to the annual international conference of people
who work on the SAT problem, which that year was in Bordeaux, France. The
document is rejected due to form details and I cannot participate in the
conference. I finally decide to just leave it as free software.

During all that time I maintain my interest in studying the bible. Without
However, the SAT problem and studying the biblical subjects have not been my
only interest.

Between the year 2000 and the year 2016, between the hours of 5pm and 7pm
any day of the week, except Sunday, due to lack of
offer, someone who followed me very carefully could find me in
a room in one of the establishments in the Bogotá neighborhood
known as "the Santa Fe", having paid for the permit to
“know”, in the same way that the bible refers to that word
when he says that “Adam met Eve”, a woman.

That "someone" would have to follow me carefully since I left, in
sweatshirt, black boots that I never took off, with a blue jacket
raincoat, and very clean shaven, to take a Transmilenio bus, because
it was not much time that he spent in the streets of the neighborhood, or in the
public areas of establishments in that neighborhood. the time is
happened in the transport, in a dialogue of no more than two minutes, and in the
"know". This despite the fact that to reach the first two minutes of
dialogue, with a woman in particular, who for her could be the first
once he saw me, it could take seconds to years of waiting for
Let experience tell me I was ready. experience showed me
that, in that context, trying to enlist her was ineffective and a waste
of time. It was very important not to fail at that first opportunity.

He usually did the activity with women he had already met
above, with which he knew he would get the desired result.
Experience has shown me that if the necessary trust in
the first chance, the statistical probability of getting it later
it was almost nil. The time in dialogue prior to the first interaction did not
it was an important factor. It wasn't about knowing her intellectually.
On the contrary, if the first 3 or 4 times the result was achieved
desired, the statistical probability of always repeating it became very
high. The result in those first times, added to the autonomous voice to voice,
They were very important for the proper functioning of the system. Y
obviously alcohol, violence, the wrong word, and any
hurtful reaction, acted against the proper functioning of the
system. It was always preferable to lick one's wounds at home and not
properly praying with Jesus Christ.

He was obviously never satisfied and always wished and sought to reach
meet a new one, one whose forms were the ones he idolized. Even
on many occasions I asked God to give me another one, whose
shapes were round, firm, large, whose temperament was the
appropriate, and that she was really ready to get the result
wanted. Even on several occasions, just after checking the
desired result, yell “THANK YOU MY GOD”. Every move was
coldly calculated and tested by experience with the aim of
maximize the quality and quantity of the desired result.

In my case, the desired result of the interaction was what I believed
it was the proof, the evidence, the guarantee of an acceptance and a
satisfaction that in reality only Jesus Christ can give us. That
evidence, that evidence, I believed that, according to Song 5, it was what the king
Solomon also got. King Solomon enters what he calls "his
garden" or "his garden." According to Song 4, that garden is identified with
a girlfriend of his Song 4 speaks of a tongue and lips,
but they do not seem to be from a mouth but from that garden. Solomon ate honey,
and drank wine and milk.

In my case, I never tried all three products at the same time,
but almost always I drank, I drank, I tasted, I tasted, I savored, at least one
of three. That was my proof, my evidence, my guarantee of acceptance
and of satisfaction. That was my addiction. That was my most prominent sin,
my idolatry, my pride, my obsession, my slavery. that was my
doom, my death, my most prominent deception. Only Jesus Christ fills us
with its acceptance, it satisfies us and makes us truly free.

That sin ends up fulfilling what the deuterocanonical book says
Ecclesiasticus 19: "the worms will eat him." I thought he meant
to what happens to every person after physical death, and therefore
I was not worried, but my experience is much more literal: a bacterium
I had diarrhea every 15, 20, 30 days. I did different treatments
and obviously none of them worked because none of them fixed the cause of the
problem: my addiction, my sin, my idolatry. I also had a series
of spiritual problems, style the man of Gerasa or the Magdalene,
that at the time I couldn't even identify.

Thus, what I called, in quotes, "my life" collapses in the
year 2016. I don't have a wife, I don't have children, I don't have a career
professional, I don't have a social network, I live in a room in the same house as
my adolescence, I have no money or material possessions as a result
of my work, I do not have any professional recognition, I have a
addiction, a sin, that is killing me slowly but surely, and the
work to which I dedicated almost 20 years of what I called, in quotes,
"my life" doesn't seem to interest anyone, not even people with
the ones I live with

In that year, I plan my suicide, I plan to take away what I called, among
quotes, "my life". Deceived by my idolatry, by Satan and by the
world, I did not realize that in reality I was already more dead than alive.
My relationship with Life, with Jesus Christ, was something auxiliary, it was something
almost inexistent.

Thank God his plans for me are different.

In January 2017 after once again asking Jesus Christ for help,
this time a little more desperate, my process begins to follow
Jesus Christ. Until then, Jesus Christ and the Bible were objects of
study. Jesus Christ was almost outside, it was something almost external, it was not
fundamental part of what I called "my life", it was an accessory, a
very interesting subject of study, somewhat intellectual. something like the above
in this video for someone who has not started following Jesus Christ but
who already believes in it, or who is only interested in it: an object of study.

The congregation I started attending in January 2017 is called
"The place of His Presence." And as you may have noticed along
of this video, there is at least one big difference between: the
absolute reconciliation after the resurrection of the dead, which
biblical sustenance in this video; and what is taught, not only in "The
place of His Presence," but in most congregations
Westerners because they deny it. It is not the same with the congregations
Eastern Orthodox, which do not have as much influence from Augustine and if more
of Gregorio Niceno, because some accept it.

Another notable difference is that not only this congregation has,
but many other so-called charismatics also have, to believe that
according to the bible "to speak in tongues" means to utter groans
INCOHERENT that each time they are repeated they mean something different. What
if our Creator were a God of confusion.

What the Holy Spirit DID teach me, through the sessions of
prayer in "The place of His Presence" and daily bible study,
It was something completely new to what I already exposed in this video.

In January 2017 I begin to congregate every Saturday in what "El
place of his Presence" calls connection groups, to attend prayer
every Tuesday and Thursday at 6am in the main auditorium, to attend
to preach on Saturdays or Sundays, to read the Bible every day,
Not every time I felt like giving up my sin so
permanent and to intentionally seek to think, speak and act as we
Jesus Christ taught before his resurrection. I do the free process of
basic Christian formation offered by the congregation, knowing that
there is a possibility that, due to the two issues already mentioned, neither
not even the main leader considers me a true "Christian"
acceptable in your congregation. In 2019, once the
training process, I begin to serve as a volunteer in the area of
"Protection and care."

All these activities are just the habits, the customs, that since
January 2017, the Holy Spirit begins to use to teach me what is
HE who must reign in my life to be able to identify my enemy and
show me who I am, what my true identity is. begin to reign in
me and start to transform my mind to really defeat my enemy and
live my true identity, the biblical identity of those who believe in
Jesus Christ.

It begins to reign in me and teaches me the way in which the flesh, sin,
impure spirits, evil spirits, the enemy, Satan
It operates on my mind very subtly. Without the Holy Spirit reigning in me,
It was impossible for me to identify it because it works with my own voice. Before
believed that I was the one who was thinking, speaking, acting in my mind and
couldn't identify it. It is the Holy Spirit that now reigns in me,
at least most of the time, the one who identifies it and defeats it.

It was the Holy Spirit, who now reigns in me most of the time, the
who identified my enemy, and began the victory in the good fight of
which Paul speaks. The Holy Spirit began to win the battle against
my enemy, the one who previously had me enslaved and deceived creating my
identity around its image.

The sin, the flesh, Satan, the impure spirits and the evil ones that
are in me: lust, anger, rage, haughtiness, pride,
rebellion, sexual greed, sexual immorality, pornography,
idolatry, prostitution, greed for money, greed for
power, depression, the desire to die, sadness, guilt,
condemnation, exaggeration of the truth, denial of the truth,
contempt for the truth, distortion of the truth, fear,
panic, fear of dying, fear of the future, pride, all those
spirits that oppose the presence of the Holy Spirit, that oppose
to my new identity, I was deceived very often and very subtly
they created an identity to make me believe that I was that. It is what the
The bible says that it happens to everyone who does not have Jesus Christ reigning in
your heart. He is subtly enslaved. The Holy Spirit was already in
me, it already lived in me, but aside, it was something accessory, I hadn't
crowned King of my life, did not reign in me. Jesus Christ was THE King but not
My King.

The notable victories are just beginning, they started in January
of 2017. But many more are missing. I still commit a lot of adultery in the
heart. It still happens to me that I look at or remember a woman with desire.
There is still lust in me. Sometimes I still wish, that after the
resurrection of the dead, could be known again, in Christ
Jesus, to all the women I've ever wanted and met in sin.

However, there are notable victories. The fire no longer burns as before.
The external symptoms of my lust are almost nil and very sporadic.
That arm that was left over has already been amputated, although it still hasn't finished
scar.

The Holy Spirit of the one who defeated my enemy on the cross, of the one who
placed under my feet, and that now reigns in me, that Holy Spirit, can
now bind, chain, expel any other impure spirit or
evil that he manages to identify. If it is a spirit of the flesh, it can
nail to the cross and if it is not of the flesh you can throw it into eternal fire
and into the abyss. It is something spiritual. It is thanks to that identity in Christ
Jesus who now reigns in me that I can defeat my enemy. to those
heavenly principalities and powers of which Paul speaks.

Now I can identify my enemy and defeat him.

The bible says that I am a son of God, because the son of God lives in me.
It says that I am accepted, because the accepted of God lives in me. He says that
I am loved by God, because the beloved of God lives in me. that I am worthy,
because the worthy lives in me. That I am joint heir of the kingdom of heaven,
because the heir lives in me. He says that I am more than a conqueror, because he
winner of the world lives in me. He says I'm good, because the good lives
In Myself. He says that I am forgiven because the good one died for my sins.
It says that in me there is no longer guilt or condemnation because Jesus Christ died
for me, he rose again, and God declares me free from guilt. He says that I am no longer
slave to fear because love casts out fear. He says that
Jesus Christ will be with me every day until the end of the world. He says
that I am free because the Son of Man has truly made me
free. He says that I am a Saint because the Saint lives in me. He says I'm Fair
because the Just lives in me. He says that I am an ambassador from the kingdom of
heavens here on earth. He says that I am protected and protective because the
protector lives in me. He says that I am comforted and comforted because the
dildo lives in me. He says that I can love because his love overflows in
me. She says that I can forgive because I was forgiven. She says that now I have
a peace that surpasses all understanding because Jesus Christ left it to me. He says
that now I have a joy that no one can take away from me because Jesus Christ
resurrected He says that now I have the Joy of the Holy Spirit in me. He says
that I am humble because the humble lives in me. He says that I am Faithful because
the Faithful lives in me. He says that I am powerful because the spirit that
resurrected Jesus Christ lives in me. He says that the old things have passed away and
they are all made new. He says that I am a new creature in Christ Jesus.
It says that I no longer live but now Jesus Christ lives in me. He says that
I have eternal life because the eternal King lives in me. He says that he disposes
all things for my good because I love him. He says that neither
suffering, nor hardship, nor persecution, nor famine, nor
lack of clothing, neither danger nor death will be able to separate me from the love of
Jesus Christ. He says that neither life nor death, neither angels nor
spiritual powers, neither things present nor things to come, neither height nor
deep, nor anything created by God will be able to separate me from the love of God
displayed in Jesus Christ. That nothing can separate me from his love. He says that
I am his beloved son and that he will not cast me out.

THAT IS WHAT I AM. THAT IS MY IDENTITY. I have already started living it. AM
NEW CREATURE, the old things have passed away behold ALL are done
new.

So I'm just a babe in Christ Jesus, I'm just beginning to
really know him, I'm just starting to follow him, but I'm already crawling on
the right direction.


HOME_SCRIPT
### And you?

Obviously assuming identity in Christ Jesus is impossible if you don't
believes that:

1. There is a Creator, designer and intelligent, of all plants, animals and
    person on this planet.
2. Jesus Christ is alive because, after dying on the cross, the Creator
    He raised him on the third day.

You can try to convince yourself, but Jesus Christ
warns that: "No one can come to me, except the Father who sent me"
[^710] “drags it first” [^711] and explains that: “What is
IMPOSSIBLE for men is possible for God” [^712].

And you?. Do you already believe it? Has the eternal fire already begun to burn it?
Do you want to start living?

Acknowledge your sin, repent, and ask Jesus Christ to come and
live in you. Tell him that you accept him as your God, your King, your Lord and
Savior. Tell him that you believe he died for you on the cross and was resurrected.
on the third day according to the scriptures that promised that
it would happen

Once you do this, you should know that you could do it because Jehovah is
being faithful and fulfilling his promise to give her a new heart, one
circumcised, so that you only have the will to love him above all
things, for his own good, because he does not want the sinner to die but
repent and live forever.

He already did it, but: Doesn't he achieve victory? He can't identify his
enemy? Can't beat your enemy? Does it keep dying?

Tell Jesus Christ that you want him to be the King of your life and crown him as
the King of his life. Make Jesus Christ the King of his life and he will begin to
defeat his enemy, the one who has him enslaved very subtly.

Does the eternal little fire continue to burn?

Jesus Christ explains to us in John 15: “I am the vine,
you the branches. He who remains in me and I in him, this one carries a lot
fruit. But apart from me they can do NOTHING. If someone doesn't stay
in me is cast out like a branch and dries up. And they pick them up and throw them in
the FIRE, and they are burned” [^713].

We must remain united to Jesus Christ ALL the days of our eternal
life and give thanks to the Eternal Father because it is his Holy Spirit, that the
gave us, the one that really leads us to think about all the good that
we think, say all the good things we say and do all the good things we
we do, including sticking with him and thanking him for
make us new creatures. Because: “Who has given him
something before, so that he has to pay it back? because all the things
they come from God, and exist by him and for him. Glory forever to God!
Amen” [^714].

Be fire, it is the only way not to burn in the eternal fire.
