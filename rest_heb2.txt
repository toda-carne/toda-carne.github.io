it will be accomplished
it will be altered
it will be as though
it will be called
it will be counted
it will be done
it will be forgotten
it will be inhabited
it will be postponed
it will be rebuilt
it will be recounted
it will be said
it will be taken
it will be well
it will bud
it will come
it will come to pass
it will come to us
it will consume
it will eat you up
it will leave him
it will lie
it will lie down
it will occur
it will pass over
it will please
it will slay
it will stand
it will surely
it will take
it will topple
it will wither
it with signet ring
it wither
it withers
it would be better
it would be heavier
it would cost
it would have been better
it would have pleased you well
