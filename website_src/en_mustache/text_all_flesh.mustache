<h2 id="introduction_DOT_"><span id="anchor-3"></span>Introduction.</h2>
<h3 id="goal_DOT_"><span id="anchor-4"></span>Goal.</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is José Luis Quiroga Beltrán, the goal of this
presentation is to give you some good news and others that do not seem
so good.</p>
<p>I love Logic. I love Truth. I love Life. I love Freedom. I love
Justice. I hope to be faithful to them throughout this presentation. And
show the arguments, concepts, evidence, and how that love guide me, made
me love, Yeshua, my Father, his Spirit and the set of texts commonly
known by the name of The bible.</p>
<p>So this presentation is also an invitation for you to research,
study, read, analyze those arguments, concepts, evidence, historical
sources, on your own and come to your own conclusions. And in a
particular and in a special way, an invitation to do this with the texts
known as The bible.</p>
<h3 id="warning_DOT_"><span id="anchor-5"></span>Warning.</h3>
<p>As a warning, I must say that throughout this presentation, and with
the sole intention of making communication more effective: I am going to
use any resource of acting that seems appropriate.</p>
<p>I'm going to act this presentation. I will emphasize at different
times and in different ways. I will repeat, I will clarify, I will raise
the tone of voice. I will seem excited, angry, sarcastic, mocking, sad,
happy. I'm going to sing, I'm going to pray, I'm going to read the
bible, I am going to dance, I am going to do what ever I consider
necessary to communicate what I want to communicate. The goal is not
just to keep your attention. It is to communicate an idea.</p>
<p>I hope to achieve my goal.</p>
<p>For example, at any time I can close my eyes, raise my head and hands
and say something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heavenly Father, I ask you in the name that is above all names, in
the name of your son Jesus Christ, of Yeshua Hamashiakh, that you give
me the wisdom, grace and power to communicate news effectively. That to
the people who watch this presentation you open their eyes so they can
see and their ears so they can hear. That you drag them to your son
Jesus Christ and the truth of <strong>your</strong> history
<strong>in</strong> history and <strong>my</strong> history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or I might start singing at any time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our hearts they are, completely insatiable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't worry, I'm not going to convince you that the bible is true. I
can not do that. What I am going to do is quote and read the verses of
the bible that I consider necessary to communicate what I want to
communicate. And let Logic and Life themselves, at the right time,
reveal the Truth in your mind, in your heart, and in your whole
person.</p>
<p>You have been warned.</p>
<h3 id="questions_DOT_"><span id="anchor-6"></span>Questions.</h3>
<p>If someone says "I believe in the bible and I believe in science", or
"I believe in the bible and I believe in Truth”, or “I believe in the
bible and I believe in logic”, depending on the person listening to it,
it is very easy to think that said person either does not know much
about one, or does not know much about the other, or he lives in
permanent contradiction and does not care.</p>
<p>This is because when you know something about the bible, something
about science and something about logic, at least that which is learned
in school, at university, and in the media, many questions arise:</p>
<p>If the universe is 6000 years old, the time that has passed since
Creation, according to the bible, how is it possible that we see stars
that are millions of light years away?</p>
<p>How is it possible that dinosaurs lived 80 million years ago and that
the bible is also true?</p>
<p>How is it possible that the universe has existed for more than 14
thousand millions of years and that the bible is also true?</p>
<p>How is it possible that the theory of evolution and the bible are
both true?</p>
<p>If hell is a place of punishment, permanent, eternal and conscious by
means of fire and brimstone, where people who did evil go, how can a
good God allow evil, that suffering and torture, continue to exist
forever and ever in that hell?</p>
<p>If it is true what Jesus Christ says, that no one goes to the father
except through him, Does Adam go to heaven or hell?</p>
<p>Why in the bible the lake of fire that was NEVER translated as
“hell”, now turned out to be hell, and the hebrew Sheol that WAS
translated in several verses as “hell”, now turned out to be a place to
which all dead people go, the good and the bad?</p>
<p>If God is good, he is love, he wants the salvation of all, and there
is nothing impossible for him, why only a few ones are saved?</p>
<p>Someone who lived in Japan, in the year 900 after Jesus Christ, who
never knew about Jesus Christ, who lived an exemplary life compared to
most christians today, does he go to heaven or hell? What is it then? Is
it, or is it NOT, necessary to believe in Christ to be saved?</p>
<p>Someone who lived a life of evil, in which he raped, tortured and
murdered hundreds of children during his 70-and-some years of life, he
dies and goes to hell, to suffer forever and ever, consciously, by fire
and brimstone, in permanent torture. Does he not receive as punishment,
a suffering, a torture, an evil, superior, for ALL eternity, to the one
he did for only 70-and-some years? Is that from a just and good God?</p>
<p>Is it not a systematic, conscious, physical, eternal punishment, by
fire and brimstone, of permanent torture, worse than ANY system of
systematic annihilation such as the "Final Solution" implemented by
Hitler's Nazis during the Holocaust of World War II? After all, once
your are death, nothing hurts. While to those who are in hell everything
hurts for all eternity. Hell seems more like an idea of the Marquis de
Sade. The one from which the word “sadist” comes from.</p>
<p>If Jesus Christ taught us that one should love one's enemies, why
does God sends his enemies to a conscious, physical and eternal
suffering in hell? </p>
<p>How is it possible that the chronology of Egyptian history and the
bible are both true? What came first the pyramids or the flood?</p>
<p>How to explain that a good God, who knows the heart of man, who gives
him the commandment "not to kill" on some stone tablets; that he himself
selects a king for his people, named Saul, through his prophet; that
AFTER that, after all that, he goes and orders that King Saul, through
his prophet, to go and kill, murder, assassinate, women, elders,
children, even the breastfed, men and animals, EVERYTHING, and not leave
anything alive in Amalek?<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> That is, first he gives the
commandment of "not to kill" and then goes and orders the king, that He
chose, to go and kill even the “cat” in Amalek.</p>
<p>The king goes and kills, assassinates, women, children, even the
breastfed, elders, men and animals, kills EVERYTHING, murders
EVERYTHING, even the cat <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Only leaves the king of Amalek and
the best animals, with the intention to also kill the animals in
sacrifice to that God who gave him the order to kill everything and
probably also kill the king in front of YHWH, as indeed the prophet did
later.</p>
<p>No, that good God, who knows everything, who many years before had
given the commandment “not to kill”, but that now it seems that he has
changed his mind and gives the order to kill women, elders and children,
even the breastfed, to the king that He chose, says to his prophet:
<strong><strong>"</strong></strong><span
id="anchor-7"></span><strong><strong>I greatly regret that I have set up
Saul as king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not
performed My commandments” </strong><strong><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></strong></strong>. Could it be that
THAT God did not know that this was going to happen? Because it seems he
did not.</p>
<p>Saul only left alive the king of Amalek and the best animals to
sacrifice them burned to the God who gave him the order, but God decides
to change him. That King Saul is of no use to him. Then he tells his
prophet: stop crying for Saul, quit winning for that <em>man</em>, I
already got rid of him, go to Bethlehem because I'm going to show you
his replacement <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. And the prophet tells God: but how
am I going to leave? If Saul finds out, he will kill me. And God tells
him: take it easy, tell him that you are going to make a sacrifice to
Jehovah. Who is that God that is speaking to him <a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>How to explain this good God, who knows everything, but who orders to
kill after having ordered “not to kill” and that seems to live
regretting what he knew it was going to happen?</p>
<p>That same God who forgot to put as a commandment "not to enslave",
maybe because now he wants us as slaves.</p>
<p>And the snakes that talk?</p>
<p>And the talking donkeys?</p>
<p>And that we all came out of a SINGLE couple?</p>
<p>And that FIRST were the land and the seas and THEN the stars.</p>
<p>And that everything was created in 7 days? Sorry 6 days. Those who
have morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>And that some guys live in a desert eating bread that falls from the
sky for 40 years?</p>
<p>And that with a little stick the seas are opened so that thousands of
people can pass, but only for short time, while they pass, and then the
SEAS close on top of an army that persecuted them, drowning the whole
army.</p>
<p>And that Noah, and the animals in a boat, during a year in which a
40-day deluge filled the entire planet with water.</p>
<p>And that Noah had his children when he was about 500-and-some years
old. Are those shorty years?</p>
<p>And that before the flood people lived about 900 years?</p>
<p>And that a big fish swallows a guy and after 3 days spits him out in
a beach? The guy Jonah.</p>
<p>And that people rise up from the dead.</p>
<p>Where are they? In heaven or hell?</p>
<p>It doesn't seem very “scientific” or “logical”. Does it?</p>
<p>Many questions arise. Many of them ASSUME other questions. Many of
them assume things that the bible does not say. Many of them assume
things that science does not say.</p>
<p>This presentation is not going to answer these questions one by one.
Instead it has the intention to kill them all with one stone, as an
additional goal to give some good news and others that do not seem so
good.</p>
<h1 id="part-2_DOT_-center_DOT_"><span id="anchor-8"></span>PART 2. CENTER.</h1>
<h3 id="creator_DOT_"><span id="anchor-9"></span>Creator.</h3>
<h4 id="technical-creativity_DOT_"><span id="anchor-10"></span>Technical
creativity.</h4>
<p>The technical creativity of man has allowed him to build airplanes,
shoes, cell phones, microscopes, telephones, watches, televisions,
hammers, trains, telescopes, computers, pots, buildings, transistors,
cars, satellites, refrigerators, washing machines, polishers, MACHINES
that make machines, factories that use machines made by other factories
to build OBJECTS that make it easier for man to meet his basic needs for
food, clothing, hygiene and housing.</p>
<p>Technical creativity always results in an OBJECT, something physical,
perceptible through the senses, something material, something concrete,
a machine, a technology, something that changes the perceptible and in
which that change is perceptible.</p>
<p>If we really want to obtain an objective, verifiable knowledge, in
which faith is not needed, that which we like to call scientific, but
that sometimes is not so objective, nor so verifiable, and that on more
than one occasion it seems to be something more religious than something
in which you don't need a faith ; then, technical creativity is by far
the most important, the most reliable, criteria to validate any
scientific model or theory.</p>
<p>No one can rationally say today: "I don't believe in airplanes", "No,
no, I just do not believe in airplanes”.</p>
<p>But about 1000 years ago it was quite easy for someone to say “NO” to
the belief that one day men would built thousands of machines, made of
metal, that fly, that have wings like birds, that carry hundreds of
people inside, and weights tons. About 1000 years ago it was much easier
to say “I don't believe in airplanes”.</p>
<p>No one can rationally say today: "I don't believe in computers", "No,
no, it's just that I don't believe in computers”.</p>
<p>But only about 500 years ago it was quite easy for someone to say
“NO” to the belief that one day men would make thousands of millions, or
gigas, of machines that can make gigas of additions or multiplications
in a second, that have memory, and that allow communication in which you
see a friend, who is thousands of miles away, using something like a
mirror, your tablet, in which your friend is reflected, and you can hear
him, with his voice coming out of the “mirror”, and speak to him
addressing the “mirror”. That was a story for children since the 1600s:
the witch from Little Red Riding Hood. Today it is called video
conferencing and is used by millions of people around planet Earth.</p>
<p>However, the same cannot be said of the very large, the very far, the
very small, the past or the future.</p>
<p>Who has built a star, a galaxy?</p>
<p>Who has built something from elementary particles?</p>
<p>Who has built a second, a minute, an hour?</p>
<p>The technical creativity of the human being, the one we use on a
daily basis, has not reached that point. Although there is always
someone who thinks otherwise.</p>
<p>Technical creativity excludes any discipline that does not build its
object of study or builds something with its objects of study. It
studies the stars but does not build them and does not build anything
with them?. It does not qualify. It studies elementary particles but
doesn't build them and doesn't build anything with them? It does not
qualify. It studies time but doesn't build it and doesn't build anything
with it?. It does not qualify. It studies gravity but does not build it
and does not build anything with it?. It does not qualify. It studies
genes but it does build them and does not build anything with them?.
Guess what?: IT DOES NOT QUALIFY.</p>
<p>That means that the scientific theories that speak of this kind of
things are not so “scientific”. They are not really that objective,
verifiable knowledge and in which no faith is needed. They are a field
of study, they are a set of hypotheses that have not been validated with
a TECHNICAL CREATIVITY.</p>
<p>This means that the conceptual position of this presentation for the
demarcation problem is to use TECHNICAL CREATIVITY as the criteria for
deciding what IS and what is NOT science. That is the position of this
presentation for the demarcation problem.</p>
<p>When we build machines that build stars and galaxies, the ones we see
through the telescope, when we build machines to travel in time, when we
build machines to travel at millions of times the speed of what many
believe to be the maximum possible, the speed of the light in the void,
“void” that has yet to be found, belief that is assumed as an axiom of
some very famous ideologies, when we go to the stars, when we can make
another kind of matter based on other types of elementary particles,
different from the ones that we believe exist, when ALL these can be
done by man and is of common use, such as a washing machine or a cell
phone, THEN, and only THEN, we can begin to say that the theories that
explain these constructions are “scientific”, are “knowledge”. Not
before.</p>
<p>When it is rationally impossible to say: "I don't think we will
travel to the stars”, when it is rationally impossible to say: “I do not
believe in time travel”, for the common person, in the same way in that
it is now rationally impossible to say: "I do not believe in airplanes",
for an ordinary person, THEN we can say technical creativity has already
confirmed the "scientific" theories that explain space and time at that
level.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, no. Meanwhile, they are just fields of study.</p>
<p>The word "science" and the word "know" have become synonymous with
"certainty" in the minds of most people.</p>
<p>There are people who believe to be certain about what happened
millions of years ago. "It's scientifically proven." "We know it"
“Science has already proved it." THAT is the attitude.</p>
<p>Technical creativity is a better criteria than the more commonly used
to determine if a hypothesis is scientific or not. Much more reliable,
than any other criteria, because it requires to make OBJECTS that anyone
can use. This criterion avoids ending up calling "science" to what is
only a field of study.</p>
<h5 id="application_DOT_"><span id="anchor-11"></span>Application.</h5>
<p>The application of the criterion is limited by the technology
created. A technology only validates the theories or models that were
NECESSARY and determining factors for the creation and reproduction of
the object. It does NOT validate any model that pretends to explain a
technology AFTER it was created, or a model already existing but that
was never necessary to make the technology, those which are not
determinant to the technology.</p>
<p>An example is transistors. Necessary and determining theories for the
first patents, in 1925 and 1934, of the FET, the
field-effect-transistor, were electromagnetics and chemistry. The name
itself tells us how it works: the word "field" refers to an electric
field. Its functional parts, the semiconductors, are explained with
electromagnetic logic and produced with chemistry. The first
semiconductors and diodes are created in the 19th century when these
theories were already mature.</p>
<p>If AFTER the fact someone uses a statistical ideology of elementary
particles to explain the FET, according to the criterion of technical
creativity, this ideology is NOT validated because it was never needed
for the creation of the first FETs.</p>
<p>An ideology of elementary particle statistics, imagined in the 20th
century, was NOT used to build the first semiconductors, or diodes, in
the 19th century, or to build the first transistors, or FETs, which are
a logical extension of the electromagnetic behavior of the diode.
Chemical processes were used to build them and mature electromagnetic
theory explained them.</p>
<p>The explanation taught in educational institutions of how a
transistor, a diode, or a semiconductor works is not from a statistical
ideology of elementary particles because it is not needed to explain
them. It is like explaining how to make a “soup” with a ideology of
alchemy. It just isn’t needed.</p>
<p>The application of the criterion is limited by the technology
created.</p>
<h4 id="technical-complexity_DOT_"><span id="anchor-12"></span>Technical
complexity.</h4>
<p>Greater technical complexity requires greater technical creativity,
and vice versa. The complexity of the machines, of the technology, that
can be built by man increases as his technical creativity increases, and
vice versa. One is a reflection of the other.</p>
<p>No one can rationally say that "it is easier to make a computer than
to make a knife. Make a computer? Uff easy, piece of cake, anyone can do
it. Make a knife? Ahh no, no way, no idea, too hard. Making the computer
requires more technical creativity.</p>
<p>Technical creativity is something that grows, that is learned, that
is developed. It grows with experience, use and practice. It is a
process of the mind. Animals don't have it. The development of technical
creativity is a process in which: the greater technical creativity gets,
a greater capacity to develop more complex technologies is obtained.
These statements seem obvious. However, they have to be made because
there is always someone who likes to deny the obvious.</p>
<p>We watch and download a video that we like on the Internet and forget
what was needed for that to happen.</p>
<p>Watching a video on the Internet implies having built factories to
manufacture each of the parts and machines necessary to build
processors, screens, automobiles, antennas, transcontinental fiber optic
networks, wireless networks, millions of lines of software in which if a
single line is modified the entire program could fail, design circuits
the size of a small coin that have as many switches as there are rooms
in a city, design and build the roads along which the finished products
are transported and build the means of transportation such as planes,
trucks, and automobiles that transported said computer or cell phone
until it reached your hands.</p>
<p>A person can use a cell phone without having a clue how it is made.
You can use your cell phone, without knowing how to make one, you can
use a car without knowing how to build one. The use of a technology
produced by man's technical creativity does not require the user to
understand the details of its development.</p>
<p>You don't have to be a scientist to use products of science.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very easy to underestimate the great amount of
advances in man’s technical creativity when its result is simply used.
The children of today tend to think that the Internet has always been
there.</p>
<p>It is easy to forget or ignore that greater technical complexity
requires greater technical creativity, and vice versa.</p>
<h4 id="biology_DOT_"><span id="anchor-13"></span>Biology.</h4>
<p>One of the most studied fields, through machines such as the
electronic microscope, which is the result of man's technical
creativity, is that of everything related to plants, animals and man.
The biological.</p>
<p>Through these studies it has been found that inside each of the
approximately 37 million million, or 37 teras, of cells, that the human
body has, there are very small molecular machines that all work at the
same time, there are machines arming and disarming communication
channels, transport channels of other molecular machines, that can also
be armed or disarmed as the cell needs them, and machines exchanging
molecules with the environment of the cell that must be recognized by
the cell to allow their entry into the interior of the cell; and
machines reproducing inside each cell a molecule that contains the
program of how to reconstruct the complete organism formed by these
cells, the famous DNA. It has also been found that there are molecular
machines that verify the consistency of said chain, the DNA, a chain
that is found in duplicate in each cell, and that if it finds any
inconsistency, said molecular machine communicates with others to fix
the error.</p>
<p>This type of machinery that is found inside each cell of the human
being and that is almost as equally complex as it is found in each
living organism that has a DNA, whether plant or animal, is several
orders of magnitude more complex than the most complex of machines man
has ever made.</p>
<p>The biological machinery is far more complex than any machinery that
men has ever made.</p>
<p>We observe through man-made technologies, like the microscope, that
cells of plants and animals duplicate themselves in a process we call
mitosis, yet we do not see that a car, or a washing machine, or a
cellphone, reproduces itself. We don't see a car split in two identical
cars.</p>
<p>We observe in sexed animals that if a male and a female couple
together, after a while, a small animal is born from the female with the
same characteristics, and that grows over time. However we do not see
that if a blue train and a pink one, join together, after a while, a
small train comes out of the pink one that grows over time and starts
looking just like a mix of the two big ones.</p>
<p>We also observe that if I cut my skin superficially, after a few days
the wound has healed and the wound has disappeared. However I have never
noticed that if my car gets a bump, after a few days, the car has fixed
the bump by its self. I have always had to take my car for repair.</p>
<p>And if a blood sample is taken from a person, in that sample you have
all the information on how to make a twin of the person, but if you
measure the oil in a car, in said oil you cannot find the plans and
designs of how to make each part of the car and all the information on
how to assemble a car identical to which the oil was taken from. Not the
same level of complexity.</p>
<p>We don't even understand how the biological machinery works enough to
reproduce it. If I lose an eye in an accident, we do not know how to
reconstruct my eye from my DNA. Or a kidney, or a lung. We know that
there are “stem cells”. We don't know how to use the information, the
programs, that we know is in those “stem cells”.</p>
<p>No one has ever created a machine that thinks, that can replace human
beings. All the machines that man has created need man at some point to
keep them working.</p>
<p>Man has no idea how to synthesize, build from scratch, without the
use of biological material, the parts, the molecular machines, that are
needed to build a cell. The human being has no idea how to build, WITHIN
a modern laboratory, without using biological supplies, and starting
from elements in the periodic table, a polysaccharide, a peptide, a
nucleotide, 3 of the 4 basic compounds, or basic molecular machines, to
put together a cell. And even if we could put them together, it would be
like being able to write letters of an unknown language without being
able to put together a single coherent sentence.</p>
<p>We have much less idea on how to assemble them so that they function
as a cell: a machine that using what is written in its DNA, in that
unknown language, it can run a specific program from the thousands of
programs in that DNA, and copy itself, or build one of its own molecular
machines, or build an intracellular communicating microtubule, or any of
the thousands of functions necessary to maintain the cell functioning,
alive.</p>
<p>And we have even less idea how to make different types of cells to
build a human body system like an eye, or like a liver. And we have even
less idea how to code a program, that contains all the information about
these mechanisms, that we find in each and every one of the cells of the
human body, and that when said program is executed, it can build a
complete human being.</p>
<p>If the machinery inside a cell is several orders of magnitude more
complex than any man-made machine, the human body is millions of
millions of orders of magnitude more complex than any machine ever
created by man. A one followed of millions of millions of zeros more
difficult. It is not an exaggeration. In fact, it is a much larger
number of combinations, but this one at least is an imaginable number
for most people. And that is without including the complexity of the
mutual dependencies between plants, animals, man and their
environment.</p>
<p>In biology, man still does not have technical creativity. We use
machines result of technical creativity to study biological machinery.
It is a field of study. But according to the criteria of technical
creativity, biology is not a science. We don't know how to build
biological machinery from scratch, without using the pre-existing
biological machinery. We have no idea how do it.</p>
<h4 id="creator_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-14"></span>Creator.</h4>
<p>There is no doubt that man has great technical creativity.</p>
<p>The question that arises is:</p>
<p>Why do some people think that to build the simple, like automobiles,
airplanes, computers and factories, it takes large amounts of technical
creativity but to build something complex, something really complex,
that we don't even understand the mechanism for reproduce it, like a
human being, an animal or a plant, that to build that, you don't need
anything, nothing, zero, nada, not a bit of technical creativity, but
only time and chance?</p>
<p>It's absurd.</p>
<p>It is as if someone said:</p>
<p>Make a knife? Brilliant ! Very smart! Great Creativity! What a marvel
of technology! What a design!</p>
<p>Make a Computer? Ahh no, that’s easy, piece of cake. It makes it
self. You just wait a few billions of years and it assembles itself. No
problem. Easy peasy. Look at them, there they are. That is the proof
that they assemble themselves. No problema. That’s the proof.</p>
<p>It is absurd to think that to write a program, in a language that I
do not know, that builds a machine that I don't even understand how it
works, that I don't even have the goal to build it, that once built it
is capable of executing the program, I just need to throw a coin in the
air, to decide if I write, with vaporizing ink and on degradable paper,
a one or a zero, and hope that after a long time, it really does not
matter how long, because the more time passes the probability is lower,
and without even knowing when to stop tossing the coin, obtain said
program.</p>
<p>IT'S ABSURD !</p>
<p>But that is what some people believe, if they are taught that since
they were kids at school.</p>
<p>It is as if in the future, a man-made machine, a robot if you will,
which can think and learn, that calls itself smart, designer and
creative because it is capable of building thousands of other machines,
a robot of the future that can create machines, but does not even
understand how he himself was built, and that the most complex of his
creations is not capable of doing what he himself can do, that that
machine would think: "I am very smart, designer and creative but my
design is a result of time and luck, my first copy was put together by
itself after waiting thousands of millions of years, I am simply the
result of the evolution of simpler copies that were adapted by
accidental changes – by luck - in my copy program, for my existence no
intelligence, no design, no creativity, was needed, I have NO creator,
there is no evidence that I was created.”</p>
<p>That machine, that robot, has a software problem. He has a virus that
is killing him. A virus that sometimes makes it think absurdly. It needs
an antivirus.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if we have that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Greater complexity in a machine requires greater technical

<li>The complexity of biological machines is much greater than the
complexity of man-made machines. <a
href="#0_DOT_5_DOT_Biology.%7Coutline">(2)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>It is perfectly logical to conclude that:</p>
<p>Biological machines require much greater technical creativity than
that required by man-made machines.</p>
<p>Then if the human being considers himself intelligent, designer and
creative DUE to all the results, due to THE EVIDENCE, of his technical
creativity, he has the logical need to recognize that the technical
creativity required by biological machines, that EVIDENCE that we
observe in day to day basis, also needs an intelligence, a design and
even grater technical creativity.</p>
<p>And not just a little grater. Since the complexity of biological
machinery is millions of millions of orders of magnitude greater than
that of the machines created by man, the technical creativity that
created biological machines has to be much larger. Probably also
millions of millions of orders of magnitude greater than that of
men.</p>
<p>But no, there they are, all those who believe that all those
biological machines are just the product of time and chance. And they
believe that it is "scientifically proven".</p>
<p>Which reminds me of something someone said:</p>
<p><strong>"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, So are My ways
higher than your ways, And My thoughts than your thoughts.” <a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>If we are going to consider the human being as technically creative,
WE HAVE to recognize that the human being was created by a much greater
technical creativity.</p>
<p>And who created the creator? And why do we find errors in the design
of the creator? And when did He create us? Did he made us and left? Is
He still around but does not show? These are all questions that ADMIT
the existence of a creator and questions that seek to know the creator.
They are all irrelevant to determine whether there is, or not, a
creator.</p>
<p>The point is that there IS a creator.</p>
<p>Do you want to know him? He wants the SAME!</p>
<h4 id="evidence_DOT_"><span id="anchor-15"></span>Evidence.</h4>
<p>All the evidence shows us that the human being has technical
creativity, that he is a technically creative being.</p>
<p>We can see all the machines designed and built by man that with his
effort are becoming more complex and more functional. That is the
evidence of his technical creativity.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that plants or animals have the same
characteristic. Birds always make their nests the same way. Nothing a
plant or animal does increases in complexity. There are no buildings
made by birds.</p>
<p>However, all the evidence shows us that those plants, animals and
people, all these biological machinery has in itself a technical
complexity far greater than anything created by man.</p>
<p>The evidence of such a difference in complexity between what is made
by man and the biological machinery is made clear by observing what
happens to the eye of the accident, or the liver, or the lung. We don't
know how to rebuild it from my DNA. There are stem cells, but we don't
know how to use them, the information, the programs, that we know it has
coded inside, to reconstruct a part of our body. As intelligent,
creative and designers that we are, we cannot use such information.</p>
<p>If we could, it would be enough to take a drop of my blood to rebuild
the eye that I lost, or the liver that I lost or the lung that I lost in
the accident. And we would not waste time analyzing compatibility with
another person's kidney, which we know beforehand it will not be fully
compatible with my body.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if some process, or program, or system, is the
cause of biological machinery, such a system, would have to have a
technical creativity far superior to that of the human being, or to have
been created by a creativity that would have to be far superior to that
of the human being. The greater the technical complexity, the greater
the technical creativity required.</p>
<p>That system, understood from an informatics point of view, would have
to be that of a much higher consciousness, in technical knowledge, than
that of humans, and not a simple selection process, which does not add
information, but it removes. Furthermore, it could not be by means of
chance, luck, accident, or SPONTANEOUS, but by decision making
mechanisms, based on the logic that governs the operation of what is
being created. That is, similar to what man does when he is creating
machinery, but far superior in technical creativity.</p>
<p>Nor could it be in millions of years, that all they do is decrease
the probability that an interaction will happen between two parts that
degrade over time, which in most cases requires of specific conditions,
including actions to start and stop the interaction, which further
decrease the probability for it to happen. On the contrary, it would
have to be in a time lapse consistent with the technical capacity of
such technical creativity. That is, similar to what man does when
creating machinery, but far superior in technical creativity.</p>
<p>Nor do we observe spontaneous processes that have technical
creativity. If so, we would have to observe all kinds of machinery of
different types and functionalities, not all biological, but some
resembling human-made machines, something like “transformers”, the movie
characters, or like those of avatar, increasingly complex, appearing day
to day. But no. We do not observe them in biological systems, only in
our imagination and in the movies that we ourselves imagine. They may
exist, but we do not observe them. On the contrary, all evidence
indicates that the biological machinery was designed by a technical
creativity far superior to that of humans because it has a complexity
far superior to the machinery created by man.</p>
<h4 id="reproduction_DOT_"><span id="anchor-16"></span>Reproduction.</h4>
<p>Technical creativity, if it really is, allows repeating over and over
the same process, allows repeating the mechanism by which it makes an
object, a machine, a technology. It allows us to reproduce the machine,
the object. That ability is what gives us the necessary confidence in
the set of reasonings, mathematical models, scientific theories, in the
information that explain said process. Reproduction of the object gives
us the trust that this information, these programs, these processes are
indeed true, that they are correct, that they actually make the desired
machinery, and that the machine will work in the desired way.</p>
<p>If we manufacture gigas, or thousands of millions, of cell phones in
an almost automated process, that gives us confidence that the
information that explains the manufacturing process and the operation of
the cell phone, effectively works, that such information is indeed
scientific.</p>
<p>If my cell phone is stolen or completely destroyed, I can get another
exactly the same and if I have a copy of the information I had in the
cell phone, I can get another cell phone that works exactly the same way
as the one that was destroyed.</p>
<p>The same does not happen with an ant, or with a dog. If I destroy a
animal I can not reproduce it. I can't get another one mathematically
identical to the one that was destroyed. We don't know how to get a
backup copy of the brain of an ant or a dog. We can't reproduce it
identically because we did not design either the ant or the dog. We
don't have the necessary information.</p>
<p>The most we have achieved is the equivalent of running the copy
program, we call them clones, because the result is an animal with
exactly the same DNA. But we don't understand how the program works. We
only know how to start it.</p>
<p>If we understood how it works, we could build an eye, or a kidney,
for you, from a drop of your blood. We can not. We do not know how.
Maybe one day we will, and when that happens all we will have achieved
is to show that great technical creativity was required to understand
the biological machinery. We would be adding evidence to the argument of
the existence of a creator of biological machinery.</p>
<p>But that creator, who by logic and evidence must exist, that is if we
are going to call ourselves designers, intelligent and creative, that
creator knows how the little program works.</p>
<p>That creator could, if he wants, reproduce any of these biological
machines that he designed, should they be destroyed, the same way we do
with a cell phone. What's more, if he wishes, he could take the backup
of the software, and place it in a more advanced version of the
hardware, of this biological machinery. He could, for example, place all
the software, all the memory, the one that a human had at the time of
his physical death, and place it in a version 2.0 of a human body, one
with greater durability, a more resistant one, one that resists, for
example, fire. Sure, in this case we would NOT be talking about the
creator that the bible speaks about, but about one imagined by a person
of this century. We would be doing something that the bible calls
sin.</p>
<h3 id="resurrection_DOT_"><span id="anchor-17"></span>Resurrection.</h3>
<h4 id="future_DOT_"><span id="anchor-18"></span>Future.</h4>
<p>Today, with advances of human technology, it is easy to imagine a
future, no matter how distant, let’s say of a million years, in which it
will be possible to make exact copies of a very complex biological
machine: the human body. If in said future it is possible to obtain a
backup of the position of each atom in any object and reproduce said
object, why not with the human body?</p>
<p>The resulting atom-by-atom three-dimensional 3d printed human being
could remember everything the person remembered up to the time of the
copy. Then, when printing is finished, the printed person could wonder:
Who won the game of Russian roulette that we were playing?</p>
<p>And of course we can imagine a future in which the aging of a person
can be avoided by avoiding that, during the mitosis of the cells of said
person, the number of telomeres in the chromosome gets decremented by
one, that copy counter that determines the maximum number of copies that
can be made of a given cell.</p>
<p>Technologies such as cloning, cell regeneration, three-dimensional
printing and computing, allow us to imagine a future in which man, with
technology created by himself, could simulate an eternal life and a
resurrection. There are already several movies dealing with the
subject.</p>
<p>But if this is the eternal life and resurrection that a man of the
year 2022 can imagine, counted from the approximate year that the King
of Kings was born, the Meshiakh of YHWH; What is it like the eternal
life and resurrection that was imagined by the person who designed and
created this brain that can imagine and create things in the image and
likeness of his creator?</p>
<p>How are those things that eye did not see and ear did not hear to
which Paul refers in the second chapter of the first letter to the
Corinthians? <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, And that were prepared before the
creation of heaven and earth, according to the first chapter of the
letter to the Ephesians? <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Let's see what the bible says.</p>
<h4 id="physical_DOT_"><span id="anchor-19"></span>Physical.</h4>
<p>The resurrection described in the bible is physical.</p>
<p>Yeshua, according to Luke 24, after being resurrected, appears to his
apostles and says to them:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>ehold My hands and
My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit does
</strong><strong>NOT</strong><strong> have flesh and bones as you see I
</strong><strong>HAVE</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></strong></strong>. And at that
moment he accepted and ate fish in front of them. To Thomas in John 20
he says: <strong><strong>”</strong><strong>R</strong><strong>each your
finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it
into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></strong></strong>. And Thomas
kneels down and says:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>M</strong><strong>y Lord and my God”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></strong></strong>. The bible tells
us of a physical resurrection, he has a body, he can be touched, he can
eat, the person who resurrects, it is not something abstract, it is not
just a spirit, it is something physical and it has flesh and bones.</p>
<p>It also tells us about a resurrection that has memory, they recognize
him as the same person who was crucified, who died, and who was buried,
and that is now among them again. They can hug him, they can touch him,
he eats fish, he has an interaction with them equal to the one before he
died. He has the same physical appearance as before he died, he has the
wounds in feet and hands. The resurrected does not return in a body of a
woman or a child, or in a completely different body, or in a chicken or
a dog. No, it is not a reincarnation. It is the same person. He has the
same memories and they remember him. That's the resurrection which the
bible speaks about.</p>
<p>So if I see and talk to the dead but I can't touch them and they
cannot eat fish, if it is not something physical, but purely spiritual,
like the dead man seen by King Saul through a witch in the first book of
Samuel, he is most likely talking to a spirit that will be anything but
Holy, one of those that impersonate the dead, an evil spirit, and not
simply a mental problem. The rising from the dead that our Lord promises
is physical.</p>
<h4 id="they-cant-die_DOT_"><span id="anchor-20"></span>They can't die.</h4>
<p>Furthermore, the resurrection described in the bible is a
resurrection to not die again because he can no longer die. Yeshua tells
some Sadducees, in Luke 20, that:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>or can they die
anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being
sons of the resurrection” </strong><strong><a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></strong></strong>, it is a
resurrection that is forever. That's the resurrection our Lord talks
about.</p>
<p>Paul, in 1st Corinthians 15, explains that
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>S</strong><strong>o also is the
resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, it is raised
in incorruption” </strong><strong><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></strong></strong>, it
can no longer die. Plus later also in 1st Corinthians 15, it says that:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>nd as we have borne
the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the
heavenly Man” </strong><strong><a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></strong></strong>.
That is, in bodies similar to those of angels, or to that of our Lord
after being resurrected. In Philippians 3, Paul explains that Jesus
Christ <strong><strong>”</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>ill transform
our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according
to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></strong></strong>. A body that can
no longer die. One like his own.</p>
<p>In Luke 24, on the third day after Jesus was buried, some angels
appear to the women who went to the grave and the women are full of fear
they bowed to the ground, but those men said to them,
<strong><strong>“Why do you seek the living among the dead?”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>The resurrected is alive forever because he can no longer die !</p>
<p>So if I die, they revive me, I rewrite the Divine Comedy and then I
die again, as probably happened to the widow's son when Elijah revives
him, or the dead man who, when they are going to bury him, accidentally
touches the bones of a dead Elisha, Elijah's successor, and revives, we
are not speaking of the “YHWH heelitta min Sheol”, of the raising from
the grave that YHWH promises. The raising from the dead that our Lord
promises is not to live for a little while after having died and then
die forever. No, it is for eternal life, so as to not die again because
it is no longer possible to die.</p>
<h4 id="in-the-sky_DOT_"><span id="anchor-21"></span>In the sky.</h4>
<p>Of course, the obvious question is: Well, if he's alive, where is
he?</p>
<p>I haven't seen him. Where is Yeshua?</p>
<p>Where is that body that Thomas put his finger in, that ate fish with
them, that talked to them and that interacted in the same way that he
had done before he died?</p>
<p>And the answer is given by the bible in the first chapter in the book
of Acts of The Apostles: He is in heaven. Or rather in the "shamaim",
that vault that Genesis speaks of, that vault that can be seen and that
has clouds and that at the time of Adam had waters below and waters
above, and that Elohim, or God, called it heavens. It is a physical
heaven, we can see it, it has clouds, it is a vault, and at Adam's time
it had waters below and waters above.</p>
<p>The bible says that after Yeshua was resurrected he appeared several
times and in one of them described in the Acts of the Apostles, while
speaking to some of his followers, and while they were looking at him,
Jesus was lifted up to the sky until a cloud covered him and they could
no longer see him. And while they stared at the sky, at the "shamaim",
watching Jesus depart, two men dressed in white, two angels, appeared
next to them and said:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>M</strong><strong>en of Galilee, why
do you stand gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, who was taken up
from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into
heaven” </strong><strong><a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></strong></strong>.
He's in heaven, and he'll be back just the same way he went up there:
physically. The same, not another person, the same person, with the
wounds on his feet and hands, with all his power and glory, Yeshua
himself announces that to us in Matthew 24. He will come and reign for a
thousand years from Israel.</p>
<h4 id="for-all_DOT_"><span id="anchor-22"></span>For all.</h4>
<p>This resurrection that the bible speaks of is for everyone, for
everyone who has lived since Adam and Eve, everyone who is alive and
everyone who will ever live. Everyone. Good ones and bad ones. That is
what the bible tells us. Yeshua tells us in John 5 that
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>D</strong><strong>o not marvel at
this; for the hour is coming in which
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> who are in the graves will hear
His voice </strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd come forth—those who
have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done
evil, to the resurrection of” </strong><strong><a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></strong><strong> “judgment”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Paul tells us in Acts of the Apostles 24 that <strong><strong>“I have
hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a
resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a></strong></strong> and in Revelation
20 The bible tells us that:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>he sea gave up the
dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were
in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a></strong></strong>. All the dead are
resurrected. The resurrection of the bible is for everyone.</p>
<h4 id="has-not-happened_DOT_"><span id="anchor-23"></span>Has not
happened.</h4>
<p>The resurrection that the bible speaks about has not happened. The
dead don't go resurrecting as they die. No, in the bible, if you die,
you cannot do anything,
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>or there is no work
or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></strong></strong>, there is no
memory of God and he cannot be praised or known <a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>.
A dead body is in the earth, in the grave, made dust and his spirit has
returned to God who gave it <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>, in other words
everything returned to how it was before that person was alive. Or as
our Lord says: he is asleep. A dead man can only start doing those
things when he ceases to be dead, when he has returned to life, when he
has risen from the grave.</p>
<p>YHWH heelita min Sheol. </p>
<p>This has not happened with the exception of Yeshua and a few others:
more than five hundred, less than 144,000. A few. In Revelation 20, the
bible tells us that these few came back to life and reigned with Jesus
Christ for a thousand years <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>, and that
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>he rest of the dead
did not live again until the thousand years were finished”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></strong></strong>. One thousand
years that the day of the Lord lasts. The day of Yeshua Melekh
HaMashiakh. One thousand years in which there will be peace because the
Satan will be chained. In Revelation 20 the bible also tells us that
<strong><strong>“when the thousand years have expired, Satan will be
released from his prison” </strong><strong><a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></strong></strong> for his total
destruction, and AFTER that then it happens:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>he sea gave up the
dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were
in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Jesus explains in John 6 that:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>his is the will of
the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me I should lose
nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.
</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>nd this is the will of Him who sent
Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have
everlasting life; and I will raise him up at the last day”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></strong></strong>. Not before. The
resurrection of the vast majority is until the LAST day.</p>
<p>Paul explains in Second Timothy 2 that some have strayed from the
truth saying that our rising, our resurrection, has already happened,
and they are thus upsetting the faith of some <a href="#fn30"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a>.
It has not happened. Not for the vast majority of those who have lived,
are alive and will live.</p>
<h4 id="asleep_DOT_"><span id="anchor-24"></span>Asleep.</h4>
<p>According to John 11 Jesus Christ affirms that:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>O</strong><strong>ur friend Lazarus
sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up" </strong><strong><a
href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></strong></strong> and then explains
<strong><strong>"Lazarus is dead" </strong><strong><a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></strong></strong>. For a dead one,
it is necessary to awaken him so that he can live again.</p>
<p>And according to Mark 5 and Luke 8 Yeshua affirms:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>he is not dead but
sleepin</strong><strong>g</strong><strong>" </strong><strong><a
href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></strong></strong>. And then he
revives her.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ refers to the dead as asleep. And like all sleeping
people, they have no consciousness. They are asleep. Asleep ones than he
can awaken temporarily, as in the case of Lazarus, or in a permanent
way, on the last day, when he promises to give them a body that cannot
die, like that of Jesus Christ himself, and bring them back to life. Not
before. The dead ones are actually alive in the eyes of Jesus Christ but
without a body and without consciousness, that is why he calls them
asleep. He promises to awaken them so that they can know him, so that
they may have life and life in abundance. In the mean while they're
asleep they can not know the one that never sleeps, the Father, nor the
one who slept three days and three nights, Jesus Christ, because those
who are asleep are unconscious and cannot speak with the awake ones.</p>
<p>The bible affirms that, before the resurrection of the dead, the sons
of Adam who have died physically, are asleep. They can't do anything,
they cannot know Jesus Christ and much less the Father.</p>
<h4 id="a-new-earth_DOT_"><span id="anchor-25"></span>A new earth.</h4>
<p>Another question that the bible answers about this supposed
resurrection is: Where are those 20 to 30 billion people, that would be
resurrected, going to be?</p>
<p>In Heaven?</p>
<p>No. In Revelation 21, John tells us that it will be on a new earth
with new heavens <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>. Apparently without seas, without
sun and without moon <a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>, but right here on this very
planet. An Earth where God lives with men in a city that comes DOWN from
heaven and that John calls the new Jerusalem. And that the nations will
walk in the light of that city, and that the kings of the world will
give him their riches <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. John says that the throne of God
and of the Lamb shall be in that city and his servants will adore him,
that they will see him face to face and that they will carry his name on
their foreheads. There will be no night and those who live there will
not need lamplight or sunlight because God, the Lord, will give them his
light and they will reign for all the centuries <a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>.</p>
<p>John claims to hear a loud voice coming from the throne and saying:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>ook! The residence
of God is among human beings. He will live among them, and they will be
his people, and God himself will be with them.
</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>e will wipe away every tear from
their eyes, and death will not exist any more, or mourning, or crying,
or pain, for the former things have ceased to
exis</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>It is not in heaven. It is in a new earth with a new heavens. It is
not that the resurrected ascend to heaven, but that God descends to a
new earth to live among men.</p>
<h4 id="basis-of-faith_DOT_"><span id="anchor-26"></span>Basis of
Faith.</h4>
<p>This resurrection that the bible describes to us, which is physical,
in which you can't die, that is for everyone, that hasn't happened, that
is in this same planet, is the basis of the faith in Yeshua.
Unfortunately for some people like Hitler, Pablo Escobar, or Stalin,
they will have to wait until the raising of the dead to be able to
believe in the raising of the dead. And by the grace of YHWH for the
ones who already believe in the resurrection that the bible speaks of,
the process of entering the Kingdom of God, to the Kingdom of Heaven, it
has already begun.</p>
<p>That Kingdom of Heaven that our Lord speaks of: It is already among
you and in you, but no one can say “here it is” or “there it is” because
it cannot be seen. That Kingdom of eternal life, of Absolute Truth, of
Freedom of Sin, of Salvation from death, of Divine Justice in the
hearts, of indescribable Gladness, of Kindness, of Joy, of total

<h4 id="possible_DOT_"><span id="anchor-27"></span>Possible.</h4>
<p>The answer to the question: “Is it possible the resurrection
described in the bible?” It is obvious if we only take into account the
fundamental aspects of it: which is physical, in which one cannot die,
which is for everyone, which has not happened, which is on this very
planet. This resurrection is imagined in futuristic movies as a real
possibility. However, the resurrection described in the bible has
additional characteristics:</p>
<p>Yeshua, according to Mark 12, tells us that we will be like the
angels in heaven <a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>, and these, according to 1
Chronicles 21, can float between heaven and earth <a href="#fn40"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a>.
Similar to how Yeshua himself rose into heaven, after resurrected,
according to Acts 1 <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Yeshua himself, according to Luke 24 and John 20,
appears in the midst of the apostles, these being behind closed doors <a
href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>, something similar to the
teleportation that science fiction movies show us. Thus, a resurrected
person does not need to walk to go from one place to another.</p>
<p>They can also become invisible to some eyes and at the same time
visible to other eyes as happened to Balaam and his donkey <a
href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> in Numbers 22 or as happened to
Elisha and his servant <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> in 2nd Kings 6.</p>
<p>And according to 1 Corinthians 6, the body of a resurrected one will
not need to eat to keep being alive <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>. Apparently it will be
something optional, because our Lord ate grilled fish after he was
resurrected <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a>. Something very convenient that
would leave plenty of free space for all those resurrected, in that new
earth with a new heavens, because it will not be necessary to grow food
if it is just something you want and not a necessity.</p>
<p>And if the body of the resurrected is like that of the angels, it
will be resistant to physical fire. In Daniel 3 an angel protects
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah <a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>, and in Judges 13 an
angel stands above the fire when announces the birth of Samson <a
href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Thus, the answer to the question: “Is it possible the resurrection
described in the bible?” includes aspects that are more complicated to
project to a future with technologies that most people can use in day to
day basis. But, if the bible is true, in the future every person will
have access to the explanation of these other aspects of the
resurrection because the bible assures that
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>or nothing is hidden
that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be made
known and brought to light" </strong><strong><a href="#fn49"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why Our Lord Yeshua, according to John 6, assures
that <strong><strong>”</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>o one can come
to me unless the Father who sent me” </strong><strong><a href="#fn50"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></strong><strong>
“drag</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>him
</strong><strong>first” </strong><strong><a href="#fn51"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>So if the bible is true, no one, absolutely no one, after
resurrected, will be able to answer "NO" to the question:</p>
<p>“Is the resurrection described in the bible possible?”</p>
<h3 id="the-cloth_DOT_"><span id="anchor-28"></span>The Cloth.</h3>
<p>To the image found on the piece of cloth known as The Shroud of Turin
they have made technical studies of spectroscopy, thermography and
infrared photography, ultra-violet photography, fluorescence
spectroscopy, x-ray radiography, transmitted and reflected light
photography, optical and atomic resolution microscopy with electron
microscopes and x-ray scanning microscopes, carbon-14, biological
studies of pollen, studies of blood, criminalistic, forensic, artistic,
cultural studies and many others. In summary is the most studied piece
of cloth with a wide arrange of techniques and technologies known to man
and has been found to have some features that make it different from any
other image known to man.</p>
<h4 id="a-negative_DOT_"><span id="anchor-29"></span>A negative.</h4>
<p>The image of the body on the Shroud of Turin is the only inverted
colors image or "photographic negative" dated before the 1800s known to
men. This was only evident until photography was invented in 1800s and
years later Secondo Pia took a photograph of the shroud in 1898. While
developing the photograph, he watched the negative of the photograph and
observed that it was the positive of the image on the shroud. There is a
historical record of the Shroud of Turin since 1357 when it was
exhibited in Lirey France. If photography was invented in the 1800s and
there is no negative image of person, animal or thing, before the 1800s,
with the exception of the Shroud of Turin and its artistic copies: who
made the Shroud of Turin?</p>
<h4 id="photographic-realism_DOT_"><span id="anchor-30"></span>Photographic
realism.</h4>
<p>The degree of detail in the anatomical proportions of the human
figure of the shroud is photo-realistic and the amount of information
per image area on the shroud is greater than any photograph made with a
modern 15 megapixel cell phone. Thus, the shroud presents photographic
characteristics and quality but it is not a photograph. There is no
image prior to the invention of photography with this level of realism
and detail. So who made the Shroud of Turin?</p>
<h4 id="oxidized-microfibers_DOT_"><span id="anchor-31"></span>Oxidized
microfibers.</h4>
<p>The material of the shroud where the image of the body is found is
linen. One of the main components of linen is cellulose. The threads of
the fabric that forms the shroud have thousands of microfibers. A
microfiber is thinner than a human hair. The image of the body in the
shroud is formed on the surface of the outer microfibers of the shroud
threads and only in the parts where said microfibers are external to the
thread they form. If the microfiber penetrates the thread, in said part
it is not modified. The image is formed by very small dehydrations,
oxidations or "aging" of the surface cellulose that makes up the shroud
microfibers. Billions of them form the image of the body on the shroud.
Thus, the image of the body is part of the shroud, of the microfibers of
the shroud. There is no pigment in the microfibers. And there is only
modifications where there is no blood. There are no modifications below
the blood. The image of the body is posterior to the blood. It is as if
with a laser someone would have modified, burned, the microfibers, aging
nanometric parts of each microfiber, burning the surface of each
microfiber. The burnings have no directionality so each modification is
independent of each other. The image is on the very surface and
constitutive part of the microfibers of the threads that form the
shroud. This is why the image has not moved, shifted or distorted
neither by fire nor by water to which the shroud has been exposed. This
is also why, as the shroud has aged, the image has lost contrast, but
the information itself about the image of the body has been preserved.
There is no image of person, animal or thing, prior to the year 1978,
apart from the shroud of Turin, with this characteristic. And then from
1978, just some attempts to reproduce an image like the one in the
shroud claim to have this characteristic. There is no image and has
never been a man-made image exhibiting this feature. It was not even
known that the shroud had this characteristic before 1978. Thus who made
the Shroud of Turin?</p>
<h4 id="information-in-the-image_DOT_"><span
id="anchor-32"></span>Information in the image.</h4>
<p>When analyzing the image of the body in the shroud of Turin, it is
observed a correlation between “image density” and distance from the
body to the fabric. At a greater distance, the image is clearer, and at
a smaller distance to the fabric, the image is darker. This allows you
to create computer images that have three-dimensional characteristics.
Thus, the shroud has holographic characteristics but is not a hologram.
The level of detail in the bone features of the image it is comparable
in some parts to an x-ray. Thus, the shroud also has radiographic
features but is not an x-ray. There is no image of a person, animal or
thing, prior to the year 1978, apart from the Turin shroud, with both
characteristics. And after 1978 only some attempts to reproduce an image
like the shroud claim to have these characteristics. No photograph taken
with a cellular, neither before nor after 1978 presents these
characteristics. It was not even known that the shroud had these
characteristics before 1978. So who made the Shroud of Turin?</p>
<h4 id="ultraviolet-light_DOT_"><span id="anchor-33"></span>Ultraviolet
light.</h4>
<p>The separation of blood in serous phase from blood in corpuscular
phase only occurs at the time of death. Blood serum and other substances
in human blood are invisible to the human eye but visible under
ultra-violent light, these techniques are used in the modern crime scene
investigation. The shroud presents this type of separation in the flank
wound. If this kind of evidence was only perceivable until the invention
of modern forensic techniques using ultra-violet light and the shroud is
from before the 1900s, who before the 1900s was so careful to separate
the two phases in the bloodstain on the side of the body and thus
differentiate it from other ante-mortem wounds in a forensic analysis
that was only possible until the 20th century? Who made the Shroud of
Turin?</p>
<h4 id="bilirubin_DOT_"><span id="anchor-34"></span>Bilirubin.</h4>
<p>In cases of violent death with torture, hemoglobin production is very
high. When hemoglobin breaks down one of the products is bilirubin. The
shroud blood remains red due to high rates of bilirubin in the blood.
This forensic information was only known until the 20th century, so the
body that was in contact with the shroud of Turin suffered a violent
death with torture, because no one before the 20th century could falsify
a detail that he did not know he should falsify: that the blood of a
violent death with torture presents high levels of bilirubin. So who
made the Shroud of Turin?</p>
<h4 id="forensic-details_DOT_"><span id="anchor-35"></span>Forensic
details.</h4>
<p>There are multiple forensic details that are present on the shroud of
Turin and which are consistent with modern forensic science and a death
by crucifixion as described in the gospels: inflammation of the belly,
hidden thumbs, high levels of bilirubin in blood, blood phase separation
in post-mortem wounds, small subcutaneous hemorrhages or hematohidrosis,
the body position with rigor-mortis, threads of blood on the face and
arms consistent with a crucifixion, the wound to the side, the wounds of
feet and hands from a Roman crucifixion, head wounds consistent with a
thorny helmet exclusive to the execution of Christ, the wounds
throughout the body consistent with a whipping with a Roman flagrum, the
dislocated shoulder, the portion of beard torn off, the bruises on the
face, the various types of pollen from the Jerusalem area in times of
spring consistent with the helmet of thorns, the flowers, oils and
ointments from a burial of a wealthy Jew like Joseph of Arimathea, and
many others. That is, the shroud presents all the evidence of someone
who died just as the Jesus Christ of the gospels died. There is no other
piece of cloth in the whole history of humanity, apart from the shroud
of Turin, with all the criminalistics and forensic evidence consistent
with the death of Jesus described in the gospel, even if some of these
evidence were completely invalid or unacceptable for a hard skeptic. So
who made the Shroud of Turin?</p>
<h4 id="replications_DOT_"><span id="anchor-36"></span>Replications.</h4>
<p>There is no replication of the shroud that even meets with a tenth of
the characteristics of those in the shroud of Turin. Perhaps the most
complete (whole body) and thorough attempt (trying to imitate the
characteristics that were known in 1978) has been that of Garlaschelli
in 2010. This attempt could not overcome resolution, pigmentation,
thermal stability and ultra-violet analysis that has overcome the
shroud. That not to mention all the forensic details that the shroud
presents. </p>
<p>The truth is that today with today's technology, year 2022, counted
from the approximate year of the birth of Jesus Christ, of the king of
kings, of the Meshiakh of YHWH, the man has not been able to produce a
fabric with the characteristics of the shroud in Turin. </p>
<p>And even if he could do it, even if he could replicate it in the
future: Where, in what part of the world, where is an image of person,
animal or thing, with verifiable historical record, prior to 1800, when
photography was invented, that is a photographic negative, with
photographic realism in its anatomical details? And that’s just without
asking about its holographic, radiographic characteristics and all the
forensic evidence only known and verifiable until the 20th century that
was found in the shroud. Where? Negative? From when? With verifiable
historical record? With photo-realism? </p>
<p>It does not exist, nor has existed in the world another linen shroud
that presents the characteristics of the Turin shroud. Period. So if the
image in the shroud of Turin was not made by man, who made the image in
the shroud of Turin? Could it be that it was made by the same person
that has enough technical creativity to reconstruct a human being? The
creator? Because all the evidence indicates that it was not made by
humans.</p>
<h3 id="past_DOT_"><span id="anchor-37"></span>Past.</h3>
<h4 id="methods_DOT_"><span id="anchor-38"></span>Methods.</h4>
<p>To determine the past, the human being has developed a method. It is
similar to judicial systems. For each event, the historical sources,
whether physical or narrative, are studied to determine the who, when,
how, where, and why of each source. The credibility of each source is
evaluated and then the historical sources are crossed examined to try to
establish the coincidences, analyzing the sources, and then that
information is used to establish the best explanation of the past.</p>
<p>The sources of the recent past have been made a little more credible
with the possibility of man to record audio and video and easily spread
it using the internet. And since the 15th century, with the invention of
the printing press, and the dissemination of the written medium, it has
been much easier to establish a credible past.</p>
<p>Thus, the method for determining the past has benefited from the
technical creativity of man, but this only affects the ability to
determine the recent past. Sources for the past before the 15th century
are more scarce.</p>
<h4 id="coincidences_DOT_"><span id="anchor-39"></span>Coincidences.</h4>
<p>When a person wants to search for information on the Internet, he
chooses a set of words that are as specific as possible to the
information he is looking for. If I search only for "Jose" I will not
find the page of the person I am looking for, but if I search for 4
words “Jose Luis Quiroga github” I will find exactly the page that I am
searching despite the immense amount of information that is on the
Internet.</p>
<p>With only 3 or 4 words that identify what I am looking for, that make
a unique set, exclusive of the information I am looking for, I will find
the information. That set of words begins to function as a key for the
page containing those 3 or 4 words.</p>
<p>It is the power of coincidences. Despite the vast amount of
information on the Internet, it is possible to find an specific page
with only 3 or 4 words that are mandatory and exclusive to that
page.</p>
<p>In judicial processes, when evidence is analyzed, a similar process
is used to try to establish the truth of an event of the past. Most
processes are decided based on circumstantial evidence, that is, that by
coincidence it favors or disfavors the accused. When the coincidences
are too many in one way or another it is easy to make a decision. Each
coincidence decreases exponentially the statistical probability of an
event different to the one that the coincidence supports. The effect of
cumulative coincidences is of exponential kind.</p>
<p>You can have different criteria to decide if something did happen, or
did not happen, based solely on coincidences. There is the criteria of
"preponderance" which is when the balance of coincidences is greater to
one of the two options. Other criteria may be that of “clear and
convincing” and “without reasonable doubt”. They all involve a level of
certainty as to whether something really did happen or did not happen.
But all of these imply only "believing" something. Regarding the past,
we can not be absolutely certain of anything.</p>
<p>In a similar way to how a judicial system seeks to establish the
veracity of a past event, historians have a method based on coincidences
to establish whether an event happened or not.</p>
<p>In the case of history the events are generated by human beings. And
it is precisely that exponential effect of the accumulation of
coincidences, and its logical analysis, which allows us to decide the
direction in the balance of what is possible, of what is feasible, of
the best rational explanation, is inclined to. It allows us to decide
what to believe regarding that possible and credible past.</p>
<p>Yet another reason to say that since we cannot travel to the past, or
see, or listen to the past, it is IMPOSSIBLE to be certain of said past.
Even our own past may not be exactly as we remember it.</p>
<p>Although the sources of the recent past are more credible than those
of a distant past, we can only BELIEVE the past.</p>
<h4 id="people_DOT_"><span id="anchor-40"></span>People.</h4>
<p>In the previous examples, the one of pages in Internet, the one of
events judicial or historical, it is very important to bear in mind that
the events were generated by human beings, by intelligent beings with
capacity of decision, with will.</p>
<p>People wrote those pages on the Internet, people did or didn't do
those events of the past. This kind of approach to the "probable", to
the “possible” is very different from assuming that the events were
randomly generated by chance.</p>
<p>Chance has no intelligence, no capacity for decision, no will, no
intention. Chance does not lie, it does not deceive, it has no personal
interests or needs or desires.</p>
<p>I make this comment for when I refer to some religions, some belief
systems, based on events generated by chance, by luck, that are
popularly regarded as "science".</p>
<p>The reason is very simple, a machine that is good for something does
not work by luck, nor by chance. There is always a mechanism, a design,
a logic. That's why there is no mathematical function that generates
purely random numbers. A computer cannot generate a sequence completely
random of ones or zeros. The program does not exist. Do not look for it.
You waste your time.</p>
<p>But there are some religions that believe so. And they are regarded
as sciences.</p>
<p>Fortunately, history is about people.</p>
<h4 id="assuming_DOT_"><span id="anchor-41"></span>Assuming.</h4>
<p>Mr. Cheerful has a large family and several pets.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheerful enters the bathroom and finds that the sink faucet is
leaking, the drain is blocked and the sink is filling up.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheerful has a high-tech instrument that lets him know how much
water is in a container just by pointing at it. And he can take the
measurement every microsecond.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheerful wants to know how long the faucet has been leaking in
his sink and reasons as follows:</p>
<p>Assuming the sink was empty when the faucet was closed.</p>
<p>Assuming all the water in the sink comes from the faucet.</p>
<p>Assuming that since the faucet was closed the drain has not been
unlocked.</p>
<p>Assuming that no one has manipulated the faucet to open it or close
it anymore or anyless than it is right now.</p>
<p>THEN, with the high-tech instrument, Mr. Cheerful can measure at what
rate the sink is filling because in one second he can check a million
times the amount of water in the sink and then he can calculate how long
the faucet has been leaking.</p>
<p>Anyone can see that Mr. Cheerful's problem is not is in his high-tech
instrument, nor in the technology that is used to build the
instrument.</p>
<p>The problem is in Mr. Cheerful's assumptions.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that one of his children did not flush the
sink, or that two of them were playing paper boat, or that the cat or
one of his pets opened the faucet a little bit by touching it while
passing by, and that therefore NONE of his assumptions hold.</p>
<p>This and other problems have some procedures regarded as scientific
but that are actually PSEUDO-scientific. That is, they are ALMOST
scientific. At least high technology is used.</p>
<p>For the moment I give this example to make it clear that the so
called radiometric dating, permanently associated with the word
"science", the word "certainty", and the word "we know", should be
completely abandoned as ABSURD and useless. This technique that is
supposedly used to determine the age of rocks and other objects based on
the measurement of radioactive elements, does EXACTLY the same
assumptions as Mr. Cheerful.</p>
<p>For any supposed radiometric dating, we start from the following
assumptions:</p>
<p>Assuming the initial conditions are known.</p>
<p>Assuming that there are no external effects that alter the conditions
of the chemical elements measured.</p>
<p>Assuming that the rate of change, of radioactivity, of the measured
chemical elements has been maintained.</p>
<p>THEN, it can be calculated the date when these rocks or objects,
containing such radioactive elements, were formed.</p>
<p>The same force that made Nazism popular in Germany makes a majority
of people to consider radiometric dating as evidence. It is not the only
case in which absurd methods use hi-tech instruments to give them
credibility, but it is the most ABSURD of them all when it comes to
determining the past.</p>
<p>We can only believe the past.</p>
<p>The statistical fact that radiometric dates are ignored when they do
not give the expected result, it is just a confirmation that the method
is absurd.</p>
<p>Dating by radioactive elements is one of the most absurd ways of
using high technology to obtain completely useless results because it
assumes too many things impossible to verify.</p>
<p>In historical methods it is better to use dating by synchronisms, two
events recorded in writing that are related to each other. However, such
dates are determined by man made records. People who may lie, cheat and
have ulterior motives, or just be wrong. It is the logical analysis of
historical sources which allows establishing the greater or lesser
degree of credibility of each particular data. And it is in this logical
analysis where the coincidences, those synchronisms, play a very
important role.</p>
<h4 id="textual_DOT_"><span id="anchor-42"></span>Textual.</h4>
<p>One of the main kind of historical sources are the narrative kind of
sources. The human being decides to write texts that narrate what is
happening, or what he thinks has happened, or what he wants people in
the future to think that happened, and he writes a record of it.</p>
<p>Among these texts that claim to record history there are some quite
old:</p>
<p>Herodotus lived in 400 before Jesus Christ. The 8 oldest copies that
we have of his writings are from from 900 after Christ, about 1300 years
after he wrote them.</p>
<p>Thucydides also lived in 400 before Jesus Christ. The 8 oldest copies
that we have of his writings are also from 900 after Christ, also some
1300 years after he wrote them.</p>
<p>Caesar lived in 50 before Jesus Christ. The 10 oldest copies that we
have of his writings are also from 900 after Christ, about 950 years
after he wrote them.</p>
<p>Livy, lived in 1 before Jesus Christ. The 19 oldest complete copies
that we have of his writings are from about 1000 years after he wrote
them.</p>
<p>Tacitus. The 20 oldest copies we have of your writings are from some
1000 years after he wrote them.</p>
<p>Suetonius. The 8 oldest copies we have of his writings are from some
800 years after he wrote them.</p>
<p>Pliny the Younger. The 7 oldest copies we have of his writings are
from about 700 years after he wrote them.</p>
<p>Flavius Josephus. The few oldest incomplete copies we have of his
writings are about 1000 years after he wrote them.</p>
<p>There is only one set of narratives, which are written with the
objective of registering true events, which stands out above all other
narratives ever written by man: the ones that we find in the New
Testament.</p>
<p>Of the New Testament there are about 6000 manuscripts from 100 years
to 150 years after writing. All of its authors were alive when the
events happened, all eyewitnesses with the exception of Luke and the
author of the letter to the Hebrews.</p>
<p>They were all alive when the events took place. Everyone. Matthew,
Mark, Luke, John, Paul, Peter, Jacob, Jude. Everyone.</p>
<p>Matthew, Mark, John, Peter, Jacob and Jude were disciples of Jesus
Christ. They ate with him, walked with him, talked with him after his
resurrection.</p>
<p>But no. There are people who want to confirm everything with other
sources that are not in the bible, those for which there are almost no
copies and for which their oldest copies are from thousands of years
after the events. And since you can't, they believe that everything must
be a lie.</p>
<p>If the new testament is not a valid historical source, NO narration,
absolutely no other pre-print text is a valid historical source.
Assuming that the new testament is not a valid historical source is just
absurd. This is not the way the human being establishes historical
facts.</p>
<h4 id="on-the-cross_DOT_"><span id="anchor-43"></span>On the cross.</h4>
<p>Jesus Christ died on the cross.</p>
<p>There is no fact of ancient history that has more corroboration,
acceptance, disclosure and evidence than the death of Jesus Christ on
the cross. If you do not accept that Jesus Christ died crucified, you
really should believe absolutely nothing about history prior to the
fifteen century after Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>People die, people get killed, the Romans crucified people, many
wrote about the matter, they had no reason to lie. Easy to believe.</p>
<p>However, there is always the Muslim who, because his imam, his
religious leader, told him that a book called quran, one that his leader
claims to know, a book that is forbidden to be read in any language
different than Arabic, and possibly, according to statistics, without
his leader knowing how to read Arabic, a book that must be different
from the one that, according to the same Muslim records, was dictated by
the slaver of blacks <a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>, slaver that was whiter than milk
<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>, that had sexual relations with a
9-year-old girl <a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>, different because, according to
those records, a goat ate part of what he dictated <a href="#fn55"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>
and, according to those records, a Muslim leader, almost 300 years after
the slaver’s death, and almost a 1000 years after Jesus Christ’s death
on the cross, decided to burn all the qurans different from what he
wanted the original to be <a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>, that said quran, or
should we say qurans, because a quran from one region is largely
different and contradicting to a quran from an other region, that the
qurans say that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross but was TAKEN to
heaven ALIVE, without having died, then no, he did NOT die on the cross,
and that’s it.</p>
<p>However, all the historical evidence, far more than there is to any
other event of antiquity, indicates the opposite.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ died on the cross. Historical fact. More than any other
of antiquity. More than the simple existence of Alexander the Great,
Julius Caesar and Muhammad.</p>
<h4 id="they-believed_DOT_"><span id="anchor-44"></span>They believed.</h4>
<p>The believer believes that Jesus Christ is alive because he was
resurrected in body and spirit.</p>
<p>The first people who believed in the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
believed because they saw him, touched him, ate with him, talked with
him and stick their finger to him. He remembered them and they
remembered him.</p>
<p>That's what they said, that's what they wrote, and they all kept that
belief until their death. Most were killed JUST for believing precisely
that: that Jesus Christ is alive because he had physically risen.</p>
<p>That was what they believed. That they had talked, touched and eaten
with a physical Jesus who was the same one they had seen dead on the
cross and who they had buried.</p>
<p>Most historians, scholars, and people who study the older manuscripts
accept that this was the belief of those early christians.</p>
<p>To this day that is the belief of anyone calling himself a Christian.
That Jesus Christ was resurrected in body and spirit. The one who
doesn't believe that Jesus Christ is alive because he physically rose,
is not a BELIEVER in Jesus Christ. Believing that Jesus Christ is alive
because he is physically risen is the basis of the faith in Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Many were persecuted for what they believed. Many died for what they
believed.</p>
<p>But there is no shortage of those who say no, that this was not what
they believed. Although all the evidence indicates that this was what
they believed and not only that but that is precisely the DEFINITION of
a believer, of a CHRISTIAN.</p>
<p>The direct witnesses died believing that Jesus Christ is alive
because he is physically alive because he is risen.</p>
<p>The believer believes that Jesus Christ is alive because he was
resurrected in body and spirit. Historical fact.</p>
<h4 id="followers_DOT_"><span id="anchor-45"></span>Followers.</h4>
<p>The follower wants to be like Jesus Christ, he wants to live, die and
rise again like Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Those believers who went out to travel the world, to tell what they
had lived, seen and experienced firsthand, those who were persecuted for
believing what they believed by their own countrymen, many of whom died
for what they believed, those believers that went to jail, or were
flogged, or stoned, or burned, or crucified, or beheaded, or hanged, or
boiled in OIL for believing what they believed: that Jesus Christ had
risen and therefore they had nothing to fear of physical death because
Jesus Christ would physically resurrect them also as he had promised
before he died on the cross ; those believers were not always so brave,
nor so communicative, neither so travelers, nor so followers of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>Before the apparitions that they say they had, they hid, they did not
moved, they denied him, they ran away when they came to arrest him. Even
when they see him for the first time, when they touched him for the
first time, they are afraid, they cannot believe it. The guy has to ask
for a piece of grilled fish and eat it in front of them. And one person
that was not in that moment, does not believe it. They tell him but he
doesn't believe. Only until he sticks his finger to one of his wounds,
he believes. They were not the same before as after the appearances they
believed they had.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they are no longer afraid to die. They are no longer
afraid of what they will say. They are not afraid of persecution. They
are no longer afraid of what men can do to them. And they suffer the
consequences.</p>
<p>For the vast majority of Jews of Yeshua's time, believing in a
Meshiakh crucified was astonishing. It was an offense. To die on a tree
was curse. The Messiah was someone who would physically reign from
Israel above all people, languages and nations. Someone that would bring
peace to the whole world. Furthermore, the resurrection of the dead was
an event at the end times and for ALL Israelites. It was not a
one-person event. That was not what most Jews believed. The belief of a
crucified Meshiakh generated a rejection, a contempt, on the part of
that majority of Israelites, towards the FEW Israelites who DID believe
that Jesus Christ was the Meshiakh and that he had risen in body and
spirit.</p>
<p>Shaul of Tarsus was one of those Jews. He despised and persecuted
those who believed in a crucified Meshiakh. Later he would be known as
Paul the Apostle, because he changed. After an appearance, a little
different to that of the previous apostles, he changed. He began to
believe the testimony of the apostles, goes and meets with them in
Jerusalem, to find out the details of the matter. He went to
investigate, find out, confirm, make “historeó” to Peter, a greek word
from which the word "history" comes from.</p>
<p>He also changed. He went from being a persecutor to being
persecuted.</p>
<p>Because after losing EVERYTHING: fame, wealth, power, since he was a
high-ranked Pharisee in the Temple, well educated and from a good
family, in charge of the military part of the temple and the important
task of putting an end to that bunch of Jews who claimed to believe in a
crucified Messiah and that claimed that he had risen ; after starting to
believe in what that bunch of Jews believed, he had to leave everything
behind, lose EVERYTHING. And he, Paul, referred to everything that he
had to abandon as "EXCREMENTS", if he compared it to being a follower of
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And after shipwrecks, being stoned, being flogged multiple times,
being imprisoned several times, after assassination attempts, of
conspiracies against him, he dies BEHEADED precisely for believing what
he believed.</p>
<p>He also changed.</p>
<p>Even today, every follower of Jesus Christ shows a change, at least
in his behavior with respect to sin, to that which is bad in the eyes of
that Jesus Christ who he claims to follow. A Christian, if he truly
believes what he claims to believe, must be careful of what he says, of
what he thinks and what he does. All of this must bear witness to what
he claims to believe. He must live as Jesus Christ lived.</p>
<p>The first Christians wanted to follow Jesus Christ, that is, they
wanted to live, die and rise as Jesus Christ. That only happened after
they truly believed that Jesus Christ had risen.</p>
<p>The follower wants to be like Jesus Christ, he wants to live, die and
rise again like Jesus Christ. Historical fact.</p>
<h4 id="dead_DOT_"><span id="anchor-46"></span>Dead.</h4>
<p>The Christian leader dies executed during the first centuries.</p>
<p>Starting with the first leader. Jesus Christ is condemned by the
Sanhedrin of the Jewish priests, elders and teachers, to a death in the
cross for answering <strong><strong>"</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>
am. You will see the </strong><strong>Son of Man sitting at the right
hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of the sky"</strong></strong>
to the question <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>re
you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”</strong><strong><a href="#fn57"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Paul, Peter, James and the first leaders are executed for believing
that Jesus Christ is King, that he is the Meshiakh of Israel, the son of
God. They die without resisting. They die without being violent. They
die following their leader, obeying their King who commands them to love
their enemies, forgive them and pray for those who persecute them. They
die following the one who they believe is alive and is going to
return.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the second Temple and the siege of
Jerusalem, in the year 70 after Jesus Christ, the persecution of
christians by the roman empire becomes systematic. The negation to make
public sacrifices to a roman emperor, as if he were God, or any other
false roman god was enough evidence against a christian, a follower of
Jesus Christ, who of course refused to worship anything that was not the
one true God, to be sentenced to death. He normally was interrogated
and, if he admitted to being a Christian, he was sentenced to death. It
didn't matter if he was Jewish or not. If he was a follower of Jesus
Christ and he considered that Jesus Christ had a superior authority to
the emperor, said follower was a threat to the empire.</p>
<p>During those early centuries, being a Christian could mean suffering
a violent death. Obviously the main objectives of the roman empire were
the most influential ones, the christian leaders.</p>
<p>A follower of Jesus Christ, a christian, is one because he follows
the orders of their leader. That leader died without offering
resistance, without opening his mouth, like a lamb to the slaughter.
That leader dies forgiving and praying for his executors. That leader
dies doing what he orders his followers to do: love their enemies and
pray and plead for those who persecute them.</p>
<p>According to Acts 7, Stephen, the first follower killed for being a
follower of Jesus Christ, dies doing the same thing that his leader did,
praying for his killers.</p>
<p>The persecution to death by the roman empire begins to stop at the
beginning of the 4th century when most of the growth of followers is
starting to happen among people who can read greek, those who can read
the new testament, those same people who belong to the empire.</p>
<p>There is a division among those who think that a purge of the
believers is in order and those who think that the movement should be
integrated into the empire because it does not represent a threat to the
roman empire. The empire ends up under the rule of an emperor who knew
how to befriend the people who believed in integration to win the
decisive battle.</p>
<p>The Christian leader is systematically executed during the first
centuries. Historical fact.</p>
<h4 id="growth_DOT_"><span id="anchor-47"></span>Growth.</h4>
<p>Given the above logical and historical facts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Jesus Christ died on the cross.</li>
<li>The believer believes that Jesus Christ is alive because he was
resurrected in body and spirit.</li>
<li>The follower wants to be like Jesus Christ, wants to live, die and
resurrect as Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>The Christian leader dies executed during the first centuries.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have that in order to explain the GROWTH of the number of
followers of Jesus Christ in the first centuries, it is easier believing
that Jesus Christ is alive than believing that Jesus Christ is dead.</p>
<p>The only social movement in the entire history of mankind that has
grown since its inception with the systematic elimination of its
leaders, without them or their followers putting up violent resistance,
leaders executed by the dominant system for the sole fact of believing
that a dead man rose from the dead just to confirm his kingship, has
been Christianity.</p>
<p>Since the punishment for being a believer was death, the only
rational explanation, is that the believer actually believed that after
his own death he was also going to be resurrected, that he was also
going to live again, just as his leader did and that his promises will
also happen to him.</p>
<p>For the first followers of Jesus Christ to be able to obey their
leader, who commanded them to love their enemies and those whom
persecute them, to the point of violent death and without responding
with violence, the only possible explanation is that these first
followers really believed that Jesus Christ is physically alive.</p>
<p>And for the death of a leader to INCREASE the number of believers,
needs that those who did not believe before the death of the leader,
those future believers, those new believers, will observe, experience
something that would make them believe that the dead leader was not only
convinced that he would be resurrected, but that they ALSO watched,
experienced something that made them believe that they THEMSELVES would
also be resurrected.</p>
<p>If I believe that my leader died believing something false, if I
don't have something concrete, an experience, something logical,
rational, that I consider real and trustworthy for ME ALSO, that I am
also going to resurrect, it is going to be impossible for me to be
willing to die for the sole fact that the leader was willing to die for
something he believed to be true, or that even I think it was true for
him, but not for me too.</p>
<p>If I only believe "poor looney, he was good people, it's a shame they
killed him", or “how good FOR HIM because he will be resurrected, but I
am not going to be resurrected”, then I will not be willing to die the
same way. The movement could not GROW, INCREASE.</p>
<p>The movement grew because those who died really believed that they
were going to resurrect. And those who did not believe before the death
of the leader, later, at some point, they experienced something MORE
than the simple death of a leader that believed something possibly
false. And they ALSO began to believe that they would be resurrected.
Otherwise they would not have been willing to die for what they believed
without violent resistance.</p>
<p>Those new believers had to be experiencing, living, something that
confirmed them experimentally, something reliable enough, enough to
believe that the leader believed something true. Something that it is
also true for that new believer. That Jesus Christ, the first executed,
is alive, that the dead leader will also be resurrected, and that the
new believer will also be resurrected.</p>
<p>If Jesus Christ is dead, to explain the GROWTH of christianity in the
first centuries one is forced to believe that, all the followers of
Jesus Christ, all those early followers, who died believing what they
believed, without opening their mouths, without opposing violent
resistance, loving their enemies, praying for them, that all of them,
were just CRAZY. And that all current believers are just as crazy for
believing in such an absurdity. It is required to assume that no
authentic follower of Jesus Christ, the one who really believes that
Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected in body and spirit, and
wants, and tries, to live as Jesus Christ teaches us, that none of them,
has rational capacity. That all of christianity, the authentic one, the
one that really obeys its leader and is willing to die without offering
resistance, the christianity that LOVES the enemy, that FORGIVES his
murderers, his killers, that does it only because it really believes
that Yeshua is going to resurrect them all, that such christianity which
was born and grew up in the first centuries at the expense of dead
leaders, without resisting, that ALL of it, is composed of a list of
MENTAL people that includes their first leader, Jesus Christ. Believing
THAT is harder than believing that Jesus Christ is alive because he was
resurrected in body and spirit.</p>
<p>It is much easier to consider the possibility that Jesus Christ
actually rose from the dead, that he is alive, that they saw him, they
touched him, they ate fish with him, they continued to experience signs
and wonders, which confirmed them that he is alive, that his promises
are true, that we are going to be resurrected, that we will live
eternally, that his spirit lives in the believer, that the same spirit
that raised Jesus Christ from the dead lives in the believer, and that
THAT is the real reason why they are willing to die loving, forgiving
and praying for the one who is going to kill them.</p>
<p>It is easier to consider the possibility that the movement is not
just "social", but it is also from God. A movement of Sons of the LIVING
God, from the Creator of Heaven and Earth, from the creator of these
bodies in which we live and therefore can remake them, can rebuild them.
That He can RESURRECT us as He did with his son Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3 id="credibility_DOT_"><span id="anchor-48"></span>Credibility.</h3>
<p>We don't see people resurrecting. The buried bodies decompose and the
cremated ones become dust. The dead are made dust in the grave, in the
tomb. That is what we observe.</p>
<p>And if Jesus Christ was NOT resurrected, if he is not alive because
he was resurrected in body and spirit, then the little book called the
bible has to be thrown into the trash. All the bible would be false
because everything points to that Meshiakh of Israel. Paul himself
acknowledges this in 1 Corinthians 15 when he says that
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>f Christ is not
risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty”

<h4 id="denial_DOT_"><span id="anchor-49"></span>Denial.</h4>
<p>If we deny the logical:</p>
<p>If we deny that:</p>
<p>If we are going to call the human being intelligent, designer and
creative, for all the planes, shoes, cell phones, cars, for all the
technology that humanity has built,</p>
<p>Then we have to admit:</p>
<p>By logical necessity, that the complexity of the machinery that we
observe in plants and animals requires a technology of someone much more
intelligent, designer and creative than men. A creator.</p>
<p>Because:</p>
<p>Despite our intelligence, designs and creativity we cannot even build
a cell. The minimum part of the biological machinery and we have no clue
how to do it.</p>
<p>If we deny that which is logical,</p>
<p>Well, it is practically impossible to understand the historical fact
that the direct witnesses died believing that Jesus Christ is alive
because he resurrected.</p>
<p>BUT if we take into account that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>By LOGIC and by all the EVIDENCE that we observe in the biological
machinery, in plants, animals and people, there HAS to be a creator of
all this machinery.</li>
<li>That the gospel accounts of the crucifixion are backed by
circumstantial evidence unique in all of history of humanity: the Shroud
of Turin. Fabric that marks a unique event, not generated by man, about
a single person, in the whole history of humanity and whose
characteristics coincide in extraordinary manner with the description in
the gospels about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>That for the CREATOR of the human biological machinery it is
perfectly possible to reproduce at will a living human body, with the
memory, the thoughts, the exact spirit, at the moment of a previous
destruction.</li>
<li>And that the TESTIMONY of said resurrection is supported by the same
direct witnesses who testify to the death of Jesus Christ in the cross,
the event most supported by reliable sources, internal and external, in
the entire ancient history of mankind.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, it is much easier to believe that those direct WITNESSES, those
who say who touched him, ate and talked with him, that they died
believing that Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected in body
and spirit.</p>
<p>So, from now on, we will try to understand the extraordinary events
narrated in the bible under the light of current technology and of what
we can logically project into the future. And not under the light of the
technology we believe the biblical authors had. It is just logical. It
is a better approximation to the technical creativity of the
CREATOR.</p>
<p>That is: with more RESPECT for the biblical narratives. WITH MORE
RESPECT. IS IT CLEAR?</p>
<h4 id="observations_DOT_"><span id="anchor-50"></span>Observations.</h4>
<p>In addition, there are several logical observations that argue
against the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection
of Jesus Christ, against being a fabrication of man.</p>
<p>Let's see:</p>
<h5 id="sources_DOT_"><span id="anchor-51"></span>Sources.</h5>
<p>The differences in details between the sources is an argument against
the falsity of the gospels.</p>
<p>When several sources are exactly the same, it is possible to suspect
that these sources agreed. In court proceedings this phenomenon is
called “collusion”.</p>
<p>It is normal and to be expected that there will be small differences
in the details between different sources, and that are essentially the
same.</p>
<p>In the 4 gospels it is observed just that: essentially they are the
same, although there are differences in details.</p>
<h5 id="knowledge_DOT_"><span id="anchor-52"></span>Knowledge.</h5>
<p>All the information in the gospels of names, places, economy,
politics, chronology, topography, geography indicates direct knowledge
by the authors. This fact is an argument against the falsity of the
gospels.</p>
<p>The writings that are currently known as apocryphal, such as the
so-called gospels of Thomas and Peter, are easily identifiable as false
because they do not show knowledge or time, place, politics, or economy
consistent with the alleged authors. They do not provide any information
regarding the topographical, economic, political, geographical
conditions. They do not give names of people or places that indicate
knowledge of what was happening around the supposed author.</p>
<p>The gospels show an extraordinary coherence, much greater than any
other text from the first millennium after Jesus Christ, in all those
details. This only happens with texts written by people that lived what
they wrote and that they wrote it when their memories were clear.</p>
<h5 id="interdependent_DOT_"><span
id="anchor-53"></span>Interdependent.</h5>
<p>The 4 gospels have an abundant number of events in which the details
complement and support each other. So in 1 gospel the details of an
event are inexplicable without the details provided by other gospels.
This fact is an argument against the falsity of the gospels.</p>
<p>An example is the case of Bethsaida. The only verse in all of Matthew
in which Bethsaida is mentioned is in Matthew 11 and it names it as a
place where great signs have happened. In John 1 and 12 Bethsaida is
only mentioned in two verses to indicate that some disciples, Philip
among them, were from that city. And, by a literal reading of Mark 6,
the wonder of feeding 5000 families with 5 loaves and 2 fishes happens
before Jesus Christ and his disciples arrived at Bethsaida. According to
Mark 6, once the multitude is fed, Jesus sends his disciples on a boat
to cross the lake to reach Bethsaida while he bids farewell to the crowd
that had come from various cities and he catches up with them at the end
of the night in the middle of the lake. And, by a literal reading of
Luke 9, the event takes place on the outskirts of Bethsaida. Only taking
the gospels together can we understand that Jesus and his disciples left
Bethsaida because there was a congestion of people coming and going and
understand the reason why Jesus asks Philip, according to John 6, where
they could buy bread to feed the 5,000 families: Philip was from
Bethsaida. And only with John 6, which informs us that it was close to
Passover time, we can understand why, according to Mark 6, there was
such a congestion of people coming and going and the inadvertently
mentioned detail that the event happened on green grass. Jewish Passover
is in spring and all the men of Israel must go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The gospels are interdependent: they support and complement each
other. Each match exponentially decreases the statistical probability
that these are planned by the authors. This type of internal evidence is
exponentially cumulative.</p>
<h5 id="alive_DOT_"><span id="anchor-54"></span>Alive.</h5>
<p>The fact that the 4 evangelists were alive when the events took place
is an argument against the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the
resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Myths and legends are generated with centuries of difference between
the moment in which the events take place and the authors of the
narrations.</p>
<p>The fact that the authors were alive when the events took place it is
a very strong argument against it being a legend or a myth.</p>
<p>From the very day the witnesses spoke, ate and touched the Risen
Jesus Christ they began to spread the story.</p>
<p>Myths and legends begin centuries after the events.</p>
<h5 id="jerusalem_DOT_"><span id="anchor-55"></span>Jerusalem.</h5>
<p>The spread of the testimony beginning in Jerusalem is an argument
against the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection
of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The myths and legends, as well as the false narratives of the ancient
world, they do not start on the scene. They start where hardly anyone or
no one can testify against due to lack of information.</p>
<p>The resurrection story begins on the scene: It begins in
Jerusalem.</p>
<h5 id="equal_DOT_"><span id="anchor-56"></span>Equal.</h5>
<p>That the testimonies we have today are equal to the oldest
manuscripts is an argument against the falsity of the biblical
testimonies about the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The testimony has been the same from the beginning: Jesus Christ is
alive because he rose on the third day.</p>
<p>Some time after his resurrection, early in the morning, some women
went to the tomb and found it empty. Some angels tell the women to go
and tell that the dead has risen and is alive. They, out of fear, decide
not to tell anyone except the apostles. Mary Magdalene and others meet
Peter and John first and tell them what happened. Some return to the
tomb with Peter and John, the rest of the women continue to seek for the
others to tell them. The two men run and reach the grave before the
women, still incredulous of what happened, but they do not see angels
only the empty tomb and the cloth with which they covered him. Some
women stay a little longer than the two men and Yeshua appears for the
first time to Mary Magdalene and the others who also stayed. They return
to tell everyone that this time they hugged Yeshua and they don't
believe them either. Some time later He appears for the first time to a
man: He appears to Simon Peter also known as Cephas. And that afternoon
Jesus Christ appears to two men on their way to Emmaus, who only end up
recognizing him when they arrive at their destination. At which point he
disappears in front of them. They rush back to Jerusalem. That night
they find the apostles and other followers gathered behind closed doors.
Since they tell the travelers what happened to Peter, the travelers tell
them what happened to them in their way to Emmaus. At that instant,
Yeshua appears among them. He sees that they are paralyzed with fear and
invites them to touch him and shows them that he has flesh and bones,
that he is not a spirit. They go into a state of euphoria and they just
can't believe what is happening. So he eats grilled fish before them and
explains the scriptures to them in the same way that he had done with
the two travelers to Emmaus. He explains that it had to happen. That
everything is written. Thomas was not there. He is late. They tell him
but he does not believe. He says that until he touches his wounds and
sticks his finger on his side he won't believe.</p>
<p>And that's it. That is the testimony of that first day of the week.
Jesus Christ is alive because he rose on the third day.</p>
<p>From that day until today it has not changed. Always the same.</p>
<p>Of course, this narration, which is consistent with the narrations of
the gospels is mine. That is precisely the point. In the case of
original sources, despite being slightly different from each other, they
are consistent with each other, otherwise I could not draw my own
version consistently with the Gospels.</p>
<p>False testimonies change according to the intention of the liar.
Especially if the lie is very difficult to believe and you want them to
believe it. Lies get bigger, or they mutate according to the convenience
of the moment.</p>
<p>That does not happen with a truth. If you believe it, fine, if not,
it is your loss. Which is precisely what has happened with the
resurrection of Christ. He is alive because he was resurrected in body
and spirit.</p>
<h5 id="names_DOT_"><span id="anchor-57"></span>Names.</h5>
<p>Listing names of witnesses to the resurrection is an argument against
the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>The new testament gives lists of people who ate, talked and touched
Jesus Christ after resurrecting. Listing names is invitation to
investigate the facts, to confirm the facts. those names are given while
people are still alive. False testimonials tend to be ambiguous and
diffuse in the information so that they cannot be easily
contradicted.</p>
<h5 id="women_DOT_"><span id="anchor-58"></span>Women.</h5>
<p>The fact that the first witnesses are women is an argument against
the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>For a Jew of the time of Yeshua, the testimony of a woman had no
statutory value. It wasn't relevant.</p>
<p>The fact that the testimonies of the gospels agree that the first
people to see Yeshua resurrected were women is an indication of truth in
the testimony. This fact shows that the intention of the testimonials is
not to convince the listener but simply to tell the truth. What actually
happened.</p>
<p>To ask a Jewish woman what happened, at times of Jesus Christ, was
like asking the family dog. His testimony was simply irrelevant. If the
intention was to convince the other Jews relying on prejudices of the
time, they made a lousy job. The alternative is that it is just what
happened.</p>
<h5 id="groups_DOT_"><span id="anchor-59"></span>Groups.</h5>
<p>The fact that there are appearances to groups is an argument against
the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the resurrection of Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>In several passages of the new testament the testimony is that Jesus
Christ appeared to several people at the same time. They touch him, eat
with him, they walked and talked with him. Several people at the same
time. They remember and he remembers them. He recognizes them and they
recognize him. The recall of the apparition remains the same through
time and the person is willing to keep his testimony at the cost of
great suffering and even death.</p>
<p>That doesn't happen with hallucinations. I repeat: THAT DOES NOT
HAPPEN WITH HALLUCINATIONS.</p>
<h5 id="they-suffered_DOT_"><span id="anchor-60"></span>They suffered.</h5>
<p>The fact that most of the first witnesses lost everything by
believing in Jesus Christ is an argument against the falsity of the
biblical testimonies about the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were members of the Sanhedrin. for
being believers in Yeshua they lost everything. They lost their money,
their position and their family rejected them.</p>
<p>Even today for a Jew, believing in Yeshua implies great sacrifices.
It implies losing your previous life. In the vast majority of cases he
suffers family rejection and the rejection of other Jews.</p>
<p>But the testimony indicates that these people were willing to stand
by their word that Yeshua is alive, because he was resurrected in body
and spirit, at the cost to be imprisoned, flogged, stoned, boiled in
oil, crucified or behead.</p>
<p>That doesn't happen with someone who makes up a lie that to keep it
means dying.</p>
<h5 id="body_DOT_"><span id="anchor-61"></span>Body.</h5>
<p>The inexistence of testimonies that contradict the disappearance of
the dead body of Jesus Christ is an argument against the falsity of the
biblical testimonies about the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ had anticipated his resurrection, the Jews knew of this
and that is why they requested to place guards at the tomb. To end the
testimonies of a resurrection, the only thing that the jewish or roman
authorities had to do was to present the body of the deceased to stop
the alleged lie. It was in the interest of both authorities to stop the
movement. For the Jews for the same reason they killed him, prevent that
they believed in the Son of YHWH. And for the romans to avoid the
political disturbances. But the response of the Jews was to persecute
those who believed the supposed lie and the response of the romans was
silence.</p>
<p>And the followers were the ones who suffered the most with this
alleged lie. They did not even have to confess where was the body they
had supposedly hidden or destroyed in order to stop the persecution. It
was simply enough for them to confess that they did not believe what
they believed, that Yeshua was the Meshiakh of Israel and that he is
alive because he is risen, to stop the persecution. They didn't.</p>
<p>The movement increased without even appearing a body impersonating
the dead one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the testimony of the gospels, the religious
leaders implicitly accepted the disappearance of the body when they
claimed that the disciples had stolen the body to explain the
disappearance. If the Jews spread that lie early, then that is the
reason why later they did not try an impersonation. If we say that the
disciples stole it and destroyed it, then it does not make any sense
that afterwards we end up finding the body that others destroyed.</p>
<p>The body of a dead man who was supposedly resurrected does not
disappear so easily especially if his grave is guarded by those who
killed him.</p>
<h5 id="embarrassing_DOT_"><span id="anchor-62"></span>Embarrassing.</h5>
<p>The fact that embarrassing events are claimed by the witnesses is an
argument against the falsity of the biblical testimonies about the
resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The testimonies of the gospels show some witnesses who abandoned
their leader, who denied knowing him while they were prosecuting him and
that even after he was resurrected they refused to believe until they
touched his hand and foot wounds and stick their hand on the side that
they had seen pierced by a roman spear. They recognize that he appeared
first to women and that the men did not believe them when they told them
what happened.</p>
<p>Acknowledging embarrassing issues is a positive criterion for
determining the credibility of a testimony in a judicial or historical
method.</p>
<h4 id="airplanes_DOT_"><span id="anchor-63"></span>Airplanes.</h4>
<p>Believing in airplanes today is not hard, but a thousand years ago
talking about a machine that flies, that has wings like birds, that is
made of metal, that weights tons, that carries people on its inside
sitting, that flies ten times faster than a dove, and that some day,
hundreds of thousands of such machines would be built to travel great
distances, was quite difficult. Perhaps it would be necessary to see an
airplane in operation to believe it.</p>
<p>Something like this seems to be what happened to the first believers,
they saw something really extraordinary. Something that only the creator
could have done. They saw a dead man who had come back to life. Just as
Yeshua had anticipated before he died. As it was written more than 500
years before. They ate with him, touched him, hugged him, talked to him,
and walked with him. That's why they believed what they believed and
that's why they changed how they changed.</p>
<p>Me personally, I cannot stop believing it anymore. It is already
something real. For me it is already a faith. But the reasons stated
here are not the only ones. So far the reasons have been rational. But
the reasons are becoming experimental and more logical reasons are found
and more physical evidence. The reasons feed off each other. You start a
new life. You are born again. You begin to live what you believe. It is
a battle. Paul calls it the good fight.</p>
<p>Once I begin to believe that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is
something possible, something even feasible, it can start a radical
change in the way I see life. Because death is no longer the end, life
becomes eternal, because it continues after the resurrection, and
priorities change.</p>
<p>I say "it can" because it depends on how much the one who is alive,
the one who is in the sky that we see, the one who loves me, the one who
looks for me, is finding me.</p>
<p>But the promise is that He will find us, because AFTER the
resurrection of the dead, when we physically meet again face to face
with the people that we have hurt and with those who have hurt us, it
will be impossible to say:</p>
<p>"No, no. I just do not believe in the resurrection of the dead”.</p>
<p>After your resurrection, you will remember this presentation. You
will remember me and all the people with whom you interacted, one way or
another, before your resurrection.</p>
<p>We're going to see each other again.</p>
<h3 id="the-believer_DOT_"><span id="anchor-64"></span>The Believer.</h3>
<p>When they asked Jesus Christ, according to John 6:
<strong><strong>“What must we do, to be doing the works of God?”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></strong></strong>. Yeshua answers:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>his is the work of
God, that you believe in him whom he has sent” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a></strong></strong>. And a little
later in the same conversation he insists:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>M</strong><strong>ost assuredly, I say
to you, he who believes in Me has everlasting life” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Believe in the one that God has sent. But what is the minimum to be
able to call someone a believer? What is the minimum to believe in the
one who God has sent? To do the works of God?</p>
<p>Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>nd if Christ is not
risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Which is the climax of Paul's explanation of what seems to be a kind
of song, canticle, chant, recitation, creed, which was already repeated
among believers at the time of writing 1st Corinthians, a song that
says: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>hrist died for
our sins according to the Scriptures,
</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd that He was buried, and that He
rose again the third day according to the Scriptures”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>The good news, the gospel, Faith in Yeshua, is summed up in that
canticle, in that recitation, in that initial creed quoted in 1st
Corinthians 15.</p>
<p>That is the base, that is the beginning, that is the foundation.
That's the faith of the believer in Yeshua, the one commonly called
Christian. It's what should unite all believers regardless of their
understanding of the rest of the writings and the state of their
development as new creature in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>The believer begins to be a believer when he believes that Jesus
Christ, Yeshua, is alive because he was resurrected in body and spirit
according to the scriptures. I repeat, according to the SCRIPTURES.</p>
<h4 id="tanakh_DOT_"><span id="anchor-65"></span>Tanakh.</h4>
<p>The scriptures that Paul speaks of in 1 Corinthians 15, when
proclaims the Christian faith by saying that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>C</strong><strong>hrist
</strong><strong>DIED</strong><strong> for our
</strong><strong>SINS</strong><strong> according to the Scriptures,
</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>nd that He was
</strong><strong>BURIED</strong><strong>, and that He
</strong><strong>ROSE</strong><strong> again the third day according to
the </strong><strong>SCRIPTURES”</strong><strong> </strong><strong><a
href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a></strong></strong>, are the
scriptures that he knew as a Pharisee, as a hebrew, as a Jew. They are
the hebrew scriptures, the tanakh.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ after resurrected, according to Luke 24, explains the
scriptures, the tanakh, to two disciples on their way to a village
called Emmaus. Luke tells that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>hen beginning with
Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things written
about himself in all the scriptures” </strong><strong><a href="#fn65"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a></strong></strong>. And later that
night when they were meeting with the apostles tells them
<strong><strong>“These are my words that I spoke to you while I was
still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and
the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a></strong></strong>. The word Tanakh
is precisely the abbreviation of Torah, Neviim and Ketuvim, the hebrew
words for the books of Moses, the books of the prophets, and a book of
writings that include the Psalms.</p>
<p>These explanations that Jesus Christ makes to his disciples and
apostles, and all the explanations that Paul does to the Jews in
different parts of the Mediterranean, are AFTER the resurrection of
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>If a Jew does not believe that Jesus Christ was resurrected, it is
impossible for him to come to understand that the entire Tanakh,
absolutely ALL the Tanakh, points to his Meshiakh, the Meshiakh of
Israel: from Adam and Eve, through the patriarchs, judges, and kings, to
the last of the prophets. ALL of the Tanakh points to the Meshiakh of
Israel. He won't be able to do it because he does not have the Spirit
that allows him to believe in his Meshiakh. That is why Jesus Christ
only explained the Tanakh, and the way in which the Meshiakh of Israel
completes it, explains it, fulfills it, to those who saw Him risen,
AFTER seeing Him risen.</p>
<p>If you are a Jew and you already believe that Jesus Christ is risen,
go and read Isaiah 53, let's see if you don't start crying.</p>
<h4 id="warning_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-66"></span>Warning.</h4>
<p>From this point on, this is a presentation of the best understanding
that Jose Luis Quiroga has of the scriptures, of the bible, until today,
year 2022, based on more than 20 years of reading the scriptures, more
than 15 years of study of them, and more than 10 years of study based on
the codification of the bible in hebrew and greek idioms made by Mr
James Strong. Study made with the intention to clarify the
inconsistencies generated by interpretations in other languages. Study
that takes into account the different points of view that are found on
the Internet and that makes use of the information processing techniques
that the author knows due to his professional technical training.</p>
<p>The author reserves the right to be COMPLETELY wrong and to change
his position at any time without the slightest feeling of guilt or
condemnation, if the Spirit that gives him Life shows him that it is
wrong.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility, if you are really interested, to study for
yourself the scriptures and come to your own conclusions.</p>
<p>This warning is also an invitation for you to not only read, but also
seek to understand the original scriptures by yourself. You don't need
to speak hebrew or greek for that, you just need the Internet. A site
that I recommend is biblehub.com because it has the entire bible encoded
in Strong codes, so that the original bible can be navigated in
different ways and understand the original scriptures in hebrew, the
language in which the original hebrew authors thought when they wrote
their books under the inspiration of the Spirit of the Living God.</p>
<h3 id="lord_DOT_"><span id="anchor-67"></span>Lord.</h3>
<p>According to the bible, Yeshua is Lord.</p>
<p>In John 3, John the Baptist says that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>T</strong>he Father loves the Son, and
has given <strong>ALL</strong> things into His hand<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In Hebrews 1 its author tells us, speaking of Jesus Christ, that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong>hom He has appointed heir of
<strong>ALL</strong> things, through whom also He made the
<strong>WORLDS</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn68"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And Paul affirms in Ephesians 10 that God's plan is that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>H</strong>e might gather together in
one <strong>ALL</strong> things in Christ, both which are in heaven and
which are on earth<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn69"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Paul also explains in Colossians 1 that Jesus Christ:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>i</strong>s the image of the invisible
God, the firstborn over <strong>ALL</strong> creation.
<strong>F</strong>or by Him <strong>ALL</strong> things were created
that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether
thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. <strong>ALL</strong>
things were created through Him and for Him. <strong>A</strong>nd He is
before <strong>ALL</strong> things, and in Him <strong>ALL</strong>
things consist<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn70"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>So Jesus Christ was the first and THROUGH Him everything was created,
listen EVERYTHING, all of it, the whole thing, TODO, todito, todo. And
everything, all of it, the whole thing, was created FOR Him. And IN Him
all things consist.</p>
<p>And according to Matthew 11 Yeshua himself tells us that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>ALL</strong> things have been
delivered to Me by My Father<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn71"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul explains that God:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>h</strong>as put all things under His
feet. But when He says ‘all things are put under Him,’ it is evident
that He who put all things under Him is excepted”<strong>
</strong><strong><a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a></strong></strong>, meaning the
Father is not under the Son’s feet.</p>
<p>That means everything, all of it, the whole thing, TODO, todito,
todo, except the Father himself. That's why in the entire New Testament,
Yeshua is called "our Lord."</p>
<h4 id="heaven-of-the-heavens_DOT_"><span id="anchor-68"></span>Heaven of
the heavens.</h4>
<p>And just to be clear about what is included when it says "all things"
in Deuteronomy 10 can be read that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong>ndeed heaven and the highest
heavens belong to the <strong>Lord</strong> your God, also the earth
with <strong>ALL</strong> that is in it<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>All things are his because he made them, according to Nehemiah 9:
<strong>"You alone are the Lord; You have made heaven, The heaven of
heavens, with all their host, The earth and everything on it, The seas
and all that is in them, And You preserve them all. The host of heaven
worships You” <a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a></strong>. Not only He made them but
he keeps them running.</p>
<p>In 1st Kings 8 it tells us that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>B</strong>ehold, heaven and the
highest heaven cannot contain thee<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></strong></strong>. Not even the
heaven of heavens can contain the Father. And he repeats it to us in 2nd
Chronicles 2 <a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> and in 2nd Chronicles 6 <a
href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a>.</p>
<p>And in psalm 68 he also tells us about the heaven of heavens <a
href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>. And in Psalm 148 says that:
<strong>"Praise Him, you heavens of heavens, And you waters above the
heavens!” <a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In several of them a difference is made between the heavens and the
heaven of the heavens. And according to Nehemiah, YHWH, the Father, also
made them and not only made them but He "preserves" them.</p>
<h4 id="angels_DOT_"><span id="anchor-69"></span>Angels.</h4>
<p>Of course the angels are part of "all things" and since Yeshua,
according to Mark 12, tells us that we will be like the angels in heaven
<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a>. It seems like a good idea to know
what the bible says about these characters.</p>
<p>The angels, or messengers of YHWH, according to the bible, look and
act exactly like men. According to Genesis 18, when Abraham was in front
of his tent, some men suddenly appear, next to him, that he recognizes
and calls them YHWH and then the bible calls them with the hebrew word
for angels. In this passage of the bible we can see that these
characters talk, eat and walk <a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> and that the bible
uses the hebrew words for "men", "YHWH" and "angels" to refer to them.
In Genesis 19, just before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, we see
that they can also have sex and in Genesis 32 an angel fights with Jacob
<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a>. The angel touches him and Jacob is
left lame. In 1 Kings 19 an angel touches Elijah several times <a
href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a>. And in Zechariah 4 an angel shakes
Zechariah to wake him up <a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a>. Angels have a
physical body. Such as Jesus Christ after resurrected. Philippians 3
says that Jesus Christ <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong>ill
transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious
body<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a></strong></strong>. And
they can also kill people. In 2nd Kings 19 a single angel kills 185
thousand people in one night <a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a>.</p>
<p>But remember that it is not the only thing they can do. According to
1 Chronicles 21, they can float between heaven and earth <a href="#fn87"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a>.
Similar to how Yeshua himself was lifted to heaven, after being
resurrected, according to Acts 1 <a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Angels can appear from one moment to another in any place, just like
Yeshua himself, according to Luke 24 and John 20, who appears in the
midst of the apostles, being these behind closed doors <a href="#fn89"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a>.
Something similar to the teleportation shown by science fiction movies.
Thus, angels apparently do not need to walk to get from one place to
another.</p>
<p>They can also become invisible to some eyes and at the same time
visible to other eyes as happened to Balaam and his donkey <a
href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a> in Numbers 22 or as happened to
Elisha and his servant in 2nd Kings 6. When
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>E</strong>lisha prayed, and said,
‘<strong>Lord</strong>, I pray, open his eyes that he may see’
<strong>”</strong></strong> and YHWH opens the eyes of the servant, and
he sees that <strong><strong>“the mountain was full of horses and
chariots of fire all around Elisha” </strong><strong><a href="#fn91"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, John says of his vision of Heaven in Revelation 5 that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> looked and heard the voice
of many angels in a circle around the throne, as well as the living
creatures and the elders. Their number was ten thousand times ten
thousand<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a></strong></strong>, so
there are quite a few angels. In fact, according to Jeremiah 33 they can
not even be counted <a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In Nehemiah 9 we are told that: <strong><strong>“you keep giving all
of them life, and the army of heaven continuously worships you”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a></strong></strong>. And Jesus
Christ, according to Matthew 26, tells Peter who tries to defend Jesus
when they come to arrest Him:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>D</strong>o you think that I cannot
appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve
legions of angels?<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn95"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a></strong></strong>. Armies and
legions of angels. They are definitely organized.</p>
<p>In Joshua 5 we are told that: <strong>“the Commander of the Lord’s
army said to Joshua, ‘Take your sandal off your foot, for the place
where you stand is holy.’ And Joshua did so” <a href="#fn96"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a></strong>. They have a Chief of
their army.</p>
<p>And the author of Hebrews explains to us in Hebrews 1 that Yeshua,
Jesus Christ, was made superior to the angels and inherited a name more
excellent than theirs, because God never said of an angel: <strong>“You
are My Son, Today I have begotten You”</strong>, and he never said of an
angel <strong>“I will be to Him a Father, And He shall be to Me a
Son”</strong> and furthermore God commands: <strong>“all the angels of
God worship Him” <a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a></strong> quoting Psalms 2 <a
href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a>, 1st Chronicles 17 <a href="#fn99"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a>
and 2nd Samuel 7 <a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Yeshua is Lord of everything, all of it, the whole thing, except the
Father who was the one He gave him everything, all of it, the whole
thing, TODO, todito, todo.</p>
<p>What angels do NOT have are wings. Nowhere in the bible we are told
that angels have wings. Angels are indistinguishable in appearance from
a descendant of Adam and Eve, of a person born on this planet. According
to Hebrews 13: <strong>“some have unwittingly entertained angels” <a
href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a></strong>. They are
indistinguishable.</p>
<h4 id="wings_DOT_"><span id="anchor-70"></span>Wings.</h4>
<p>Those who do have wings are the Seraphim of Isaiah 6, the Cherubim of
Ezekiel and the living creatures or animals of Revelation 4. 3 different
names for the same creatures that surround the throne of God <a
href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a>. But another meaning of the hebrew
word is “extremity” <a href="#fn103" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref103"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>103</sup></a>, so they can easily be something
other than wings as we see in birds.</p>
<p>In these 4 creatures, that John tells us about, it seems that the 6
extremities <a href="#fn104" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref104"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>104</sup></a> correspond with those of Isaiah <a
href="#fn105" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref105"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>105</sup></a> and with those of Ezekiel <a
href="#fn106" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref106"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>106</sup></a> if 2 are calf feet with some wing
structure, 2 are arms with some wing structure and 2 are wings as we see
in eagles.</p>
<p>These creatures seem to be simple animals more than any other thing.
These creatures do not appear to be very intelligent or have awareness.
The most they do is repeat a phrase like parrots <a href="#fn107"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref107"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>107</sup></a>, or pass an object <a
href="#fn108" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref108"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>108</sup></a>. Also when they do this, it only
happens in a vision and not in a narrative that describes physical
events. In these tasks, as intelligent as a dog or a parrot. In fact
some times they function as watchdogs according to Genesis 3 <a
href="#fn109" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref109"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>109</sup></a>. Or protectors, according to
Ezekiel 28 <a href="#fn110" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref110"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>110</sup></a>, which directly compares the king
of Tyre, and the Satan indirectly, with one of these animals, perhaps
because the Satan was from the heavenly council, that is, very close to
YHWH.</p>
<p>The translation of Seraph, the singular of Seraphim, is serpent. An
animal. And 3 of the total of 4 faces that the Cherubim have are of an
animal: one is of an eagle, one is of a calf and one is of a lion. And
his legs are from calf, although they also appear to have some wing
structure. Also, according to Psalm 18, YHWH likes to ride them <a
href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Powerful animals, very intelligent, for animals, and very beautiful,
but animals after all. Some kind of heavenly pets. Creatures that only
the creator could have designed because according to Ezekiel they seem
to have the body of a man <a href="#fn112" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref112" role="doc-noteref"><sup>112</sup></a> and have
extraordinary capacities like changing their face to any of 4 possible
<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a>. A kind of biological
transformers. They emit light that comes from their interior that
appears to be like <span id="anchor-71"></span>burning coals of fire <a
href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a>. One of them even take with their
hand of said fire inside them and give it to a man dressed in linen <a
href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a>. And, according to Ezekiel 1, they
run like the lightning <a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref"

<p>Powerful animals but animals after all.</p>
<h4 id="creation_DOT_"><span id="anchor-72"></span>Creation.</h4>
<p>The bible describes creation, or what the author of Hebrews 9 calls
“THIS creation” <a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a>, in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2.</p>
<p>Many people try to reconcile what the text of Genesis says with the
ideas of a religion that passes itself off as science. Or with
preconceived ideas of what the text narrates.</p>
<p>But there is really no need if we read the text as it is.</p>
<p>And if we do not deny what is logically obvious: That there HAS to be
a creator.</p>
<p>And let's remember that it HAS to exist because</p>
<p>If we are going to call the human being intelligent, designer and
creative, for all planes, shoes, cell phones, cars, for all the
technology, that men has built,</p>
<p>We have to</p>
<p>To admit, by logical necessity, that the complexity of the biological
machinery that we observe in plants and animals requires a technology of
someone much more intelligent, designer and creative than the human
being. A creator.</p>
<p>It is simple observation and logic.</p>
<p>That is why, let us remember that in this presentation we seek to
understand the extraordinary events narrated in the bible under the
light of current technology and that which we can logically project into
the future. And not under the light of the technology that we believe
the biblical authors had. That’s the logical thing to do. It is a better
approximation to the technical creativity of the Creator. The evidence
shows us that it is much more advanced.</p>
<p>Doing this and studying a bit of the original hebrew, the description
of Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 can be understood consistently with
futuristic projections of the current technology of man.</p>
<p>The first verse specifies for us that it is going to speak about two
parts: the shamaim, translated as the heavens, and the earth.
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong>n the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn118"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Here it is important to clarify that the hebrew word for creating
also accepts the idea of building, organizing, shaping, assembling.</p>
<p>In the next verse we see that there were things pre-existing to what
he is about to create, organize or assemble:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong>nd the earth was without
form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the
Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a></strong></strong>. There was
already an “earth without form”, a “deep” and some “waters”. And
everything was dark and messy. It is not difficult to imagine a planet
full of water but empty and dark from the lack of a transparent
atmosphere.</p>
<p>It is evident the multiple interdependence of plants, animals and the
environment. The functioning of the biological machinery depends
mutually, in multiple ways, of other biological machines, that is why
they are called “ecosystems”. But there is also a dependency on the
environment. The biological machinery of this planet can only function
at certain temperatures, certain atmospheric pressures, some only in
presence of oxygen, of air, because they need to breathe, many of them
need to consume water to continue functioning. The whole biological
system of the planet depends on characteristics present only on this
planet.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not difficult to imagine that everything had to be put in
operation in a period of time that would allow the global system to
start without collapsing. A span of time like the one described in
Genesis 1 and 2: 6 spins of the planet on its axis. 6 days. Period.</p>
<h5 id="day-1_DOT_"><span id="anchor-73"></span>Day 1.</h5>
<p>The third verse of the bible tells us what Elohim did on the first
day: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong>nd God said, Let there
be light: and there was light<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn120"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a></strong></strong>. If we follow
the established context, it is the moment in which the creator gives the
command to use His highly advanced technology to generate an atmosphere
that allows the passage of light so that it is possible to begin to
differentiate day from night. The process starts and it takes no more
than one rotation of this planet on its axis before it is possible to
distinguish the two states: one of light and one of darkness.</p>
<h5 id="day-2_DOT_"><span id="anchor-74"></span>Day 2.</h5>
<p>The sixth verse sums up the second day for us:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>Le</strong><strong>t there be an
expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from
the waters” </strong><strong><a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a></strong></strong>.
Following the given context, it is the moment in which the order to
create, according to a pre-established design, a separation of waters,
one body of water is under the expanse directly on the planet and the
other body of water above the expanse in an outer orbit. To the space
between the two masses of water, to that expanse, he calls it "shamaim"
which is translated "heavens".</p>
<h5 id="day-3_DOT_"><span id="anchor-75"></span>Day 3.</h5>
<p>On the third day Elohim separates the dry from the lower body of
water, the one under the heavens. If the text is reconciled with the
physical evidence that we observe even today, even after the times of
Noah, the process generates a granite shell around the planet that has
an interconnected subterranean ocean below and with large shallow lakes
over said shell. Upon said shell of granite, the creator appears, or
using cinematographic terminology: tele-generated by globalized parallel
atomic copy, all vegetation, all the plants, already mature, with which
he had thought to start the reproductive process of the plant
kingdom.</p>
<h5 id="day-4_DOT_"><span id="anchor-76"></span>Day 4.</h5>
<p>The fourth day He modifies the atmosphere enough so that it can be
observed the sun during the day and the moon and stars at night. It is
to be observed that objects external to the atmosphere already
physically existed. The plasma candle that we call the sun and the
quasi-spherical object that reflects the light coming from the sun that
we call moon, they already physically existed. What he creates at this
moment, what he shapes, organizes, arranges, are the lights, or
luminaries in some translations. He creates them through the physical
transformations in temperature, distance, rotation, and so on, which are
necessary to keep the biological machinery on the planet running.</p>
<h5 id="day-5_DOT_"><span id="anchor-77"></span>Day 5.</h5>
<p>On the fifth day Elohim gives the command to create all the aquatic
animals adults and adult birds with which He decided, during the design
stage, start the reproductive process of these animals. And he did it in
similar manner to how he created all the vegetation on the planet: by
globalized parallel atomic tele-copying, in cinematographic terminology.
In other words, a three-dimensional and parallel atomic copy-paste.</p>
<h5 id="day-6_DOT_"><span id="anchor-78"></span>Day 6.</h5>
<p>On the sixth day he made the rest of the adult animals, the
terrestrial ones, and the first man. He did it in a similar way to how
He created plants, aquatic animals and birds, similarly as a human being
of today creates a document on his computer. He tells him "sonny, create
document". In this case everything was done through another son, the
master copy: the son of God, the Lord of Lords, the King of Kings, The
Only Begotten Son of God, The First and the Last, The Meshiakh of
Israel: Yeshua HaMashiakh, Our Savior Jesus Christ. That He could have
done early in the morning in a nanosecond. He left homework to his
creation, Adam, to give names to domestic animals and ONLY domestic
animals. Both, those of the air and those of the field, but only the
domestic ones, the logical thing to do. The hebrew word coded as H929 <a
href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a> indicates so. And then, over the
evening, when Adam had already done his homework, Elohim puts him to
sleep and creates his partner.</p>
<h5 id="easy_DOT_"><span id="anchor-79"></span>Easy.</h5>
<p>If we really accept the logical. That:</p>
<p>If we are going to call the human being intelligent, designer and
creative, for all planes, shoes, cell phones, cars, for all the
technology that he has built,</p>
<p>We have to</p>
<p>To admit, by logical necessity, that the complexity of the biological
machinery that we observe in plants and animals requires a technology of
someone much more intelligent, designer and creative than the human
being. A creator.</p>
<p>If we really accept that there HAS to be, by logical necessity, a
creator with a technology that we can barely imagine.</p>
<p>And if we read Genesis 1 and 2 as they are written, and not as we
were taught to read them, or how we want to read them so that they fit
our preconceived ideas, it is not so difficult to believe them.</p>
<p>Today, with today's technology, imagining that of the creator, it is
not so hard to believe the first two chapters of Genesis.</p>
<p>The bible is a practical book. It tells us about what we can see,
about what that we can touch, of what is within our reach, of what we
can check. Not about alpha centauri and about galaxies billions of light
years far away.</p>
<h4 id="the-previous_DOT_"><span id="anchor-80"></span>The previous.</h4>
<p>But according to the same scriptures, according to the bible, there
are things that existed before the creation described in Genesis 1 and
2.</p>
<h5 id="elohim_DOT_"><span id="anchor-81"></span>Elohim.</h5>
<p>The very word Elohim, who is the Creator, according to Genesis 1 and
2, already existed since he is the creator. Thus, Elohim is not part of
what was created in Genesis 1 and 2. He already was. He already existed.
It's obvious but you have to mention it because there are people who
like to deny the obvious.</p>
<h5 id="yeshua_DOT_"><span id="anchor-82"></span>Yeshua.</h5>
<p>Yeshua, our Lord Jesus Christ, even if not everyone is aware that He
is their lord, or do not want to recognize Him as such, is neither part
of THIS creation nor of anything created. According to John 1,
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>n the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was
in the beginning with God. All things were made by him ; and without him
was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was
the light of men” </strong><strong><a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a></strong></strong>,
and then tells us that:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>An</strong><strong>d the Word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the
only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a></strong></strong>. And he ends up
identifying the Word with Jesus Christ saying
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>g</strong>race and truth came by Jesus
Christ<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a></strong></strong>.
All things were made by through Yeshua and without Him nothing was made
that was made. Yeshua is prior to anything created including THIS
creation.</p>
<h5 id="ruakh-hakodesh_DOT_"><span id="anchor-83"></span>Ruakh
HaKodesh.</h5>
<p>The Holy Spirit or “Wind” already existed. It's obvious but you have
to mention it because there are people who like to deny the obvious.</p>
<h5 id="the-sons-of-elohim_DOT_"><span id="anchor-84"></span>The Sons of
Elohim.</h5>
<p>The "beni-haelohim", the sons of Elohim <a href="#fn126"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a>, the union of the words H1121 and
H430 of the Strong code are not part of THIS creation. Nowhere in
Genesis 1 and 2 does this expression appear. The Satan is part of this
group and so are the angels. The book of job indicates so. The bible
refers to men as the sons of Adam, not like the sons of Elohim. Thus,
the sons of Elohim are not part of THIS creation.</p>
<h5 id="the-angels_DOT_"><span id="anchor-85"></span>The Angels.</h5>
<p>Nowhere in the creation account of Genesis 1 and 2 appears the hebrew
word coded as H4397 <a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a>, the word “malakh” in the
singular, or “malakhim” in the plural, used in the bible for “angel” or
“messenger”. In addition, in Psalm 8, the word Elohim is also used, that
which is for the Creator, to refer to the angels as a whole <a
href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a>. The angels are not part of THIS
creation.</p>
<h5 id="the-satan-and-company_DOT_"><span id="anchor-86"></span>The Satan
and company.</h5>
<p>The "beni-haelohim" who were not any good little angels, all those
children of Elohim who opposed YHWH, Jehovah, Elohim, when he created
the human being, they are not part of THIS creation either. Among them
is the Satan, the ancient serpent, the devil, the first liar and the
first murderer, all titles of the person who is only named in the bible
by these titles. The same one that initiates the little problem of
disobedience when he deceived Eve. The Satan and company are not part of
THIS creation because they are a subset of the beni-haelohim who are not
part of of THIS creation.</p>
<h5 id="the-winged-ones_DOT_"><span id="anchor-87"></span>The Winged
Ones.</h5>
<p>The Seraphim of Isaiah 6, the Cherubim of Ezekiel and the living
creatures or animals of Revelation 4, those of which we have already
spoken, they were already created. These mighty animals that are ridden
by YHWH and that have 6 extremities and 4 possible faces, these kind of
biological transformers that are celestial pets, they were already
created when Elohim created this heaven and this earth.</p>
<h5 id="the-stars_DOT_"><span id="anchor-88"></span>The stars.</h5>
<p>Neither do the stars. The only occurrence in Genesis 1 and 2 of the
word used in the bible for “star”, the word H3556 <a href="#fn129"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref129"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>129</sup></a>, is under the verb GOVERN, NOT
under the verb CREATE. This is an example of how even translators are
carried away by preconceived ideas. The lesser star, that is the light
of the moon, governs the night and the "kakobim", which means, the
stars. The stars are also not part of what was created in Genesis 1 and
2. This is perfectly consistent with the fact that the "heavens" of the
Genesis also have a heaven, which was also created by YHWH, but BEFORE
THIS creation.</p>
<h5 id="a-part-of-the-armies-of-heaven_DOT_"><span id="anchor-89"></span>A
part of the armies of Heaven.</h5>
<p>The armies of heaven include the sons of Elohim, Satan and company,
the angels, the stars and all the animals that fly in the sky. And since
only the last ones are part of THIS creation, good part of the armies of
heaven are NOT part of THIS creation. In Genesis 1 were completed YES,
when the animals that fly in the sky were made, but before THIS creation
there was already a good part of the armies of heaven. The hebrew word
for “armies”, the word coded as H6635 <a href="#fn130"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref130"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>130</sup></a>, the word “tsaba” only appears ONE
time in Genesis 1, and appears AFTER the creation of man, and in the
context of FINISHING the “armies” of what is on earth and in the
heavens, those that have just been created. A good part of the armies of
the heavens already existed BEFORE THIS creation.</p>
<h5 id="heaven-of-heavens_DOT_"><span id="anchor-90"></span>Heaven of
Heavens.</h5>
<p>The expression heaven of heavens appears a few times in the bible. It
is the union of the word H8064 in the singular with the same in the
plural <a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a>. Shami-hashamaim and on various
occasions it is used in contrast to the plural only referring to the
shamaim created in Genesis 1, as used for example in Deuteronomy 10 <a
href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a>. First in the plural and then the
combination separated by a vev, the hebrew letter used to separate
phrases. The shamaim is part of THIS creation, the one narrated in
Genesis 1 and 2. The heaven of the heavens is NOT. That heaven already
was, already existed. In it were the sons of Elohim, Satan and company,
the angels and the stars. Well, the Satan and company were not yet the
Satan and company, they were still good little angels, they had not yet
opposed the Creator. But the idea is clear.</p>
<h4 id="consistency_DOT_"><span id="anchor-91"></span>Consistency.</h4>
<p>What was created in Genesis 1 and 2 is what we see on this planet:
plants, animals, people, the earth and the skies, those that if we look
up, we can see that they have clouds, and that in Noah's time they had
waters above. The bible is practical, it does not tell us about other
planets or things to which man has no access. The theme of Genesis 1 and
2 is limited to THIS creation.</p>
<p>Of course this is only ONE way to coherently understand the bible
with what the technical creativity of man that we use in day to day
basis allows us to project logically. Because if we compare it with the
technical creativity necessary for all the biological machinery that we
observe in everyday life: plants, animals and people, it is rationally
undeniable that there HAS to be a Creator much more intelligent and
creative than the human being. That Elohim of Genesis 1. This is just
what seems to be the most literal of all ways to understand a text that
had to be designed for all ages and all times.</p>
<p>Technical creativity is the best criterion to distinguish a religion
from a science. Yes, Christianity is a Faith. It has never denied it.
Yes, it claims to be the only true faith because it comes from the only
True God. But it is much more logical and coherent, with that technical
creativity that we observe, than the rest of religions, including some
pretending to be sciences.</p>
<p>According to the bible, Yeshua is Lord of Lords over EVERYTHING, all
of it, the whole thing, TODO, todito, todo, including everything prior
to THIS creation, because those things were ALSO created by Yeshua and
were given to him by his Father.</p>
<p>This way of understanding the bible does not contradict anything that
is written on it and seems to be the most literal of all.</p>
<h3 id="saviour_DOT_"><span id="anchor-92"></span>Saviour.</h3>
<p>According to the bible, in Luke 2, it is said of Yeshua that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong>or unto you is born this day
in the city of David a <strong>SAVIOUR</strong>, which is Christ the
Lord<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a></strong></strong>,
and in John 4 some Samaritans say of Jesus Christ that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>e have heard him
ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the
</strong><strong>SAVIOUR</strong><strong> of the world”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, according to the bible, Jesus Christ is Savior.</p>
<p>But savior from what? What did He save us from?</p>
<p>There are only two ways to see existence:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Physical life does NOT continue after the physical death because
there is NO resurrection. Physical death is the end. Period. It's all
over and it's forever. Physical death is eternal. Or exclusively</li>
<li>Physical life DOES continue after the physical death because there
IS resurrection. Physical death is NOT the end. Jesus Christ was
physically resurrected, is alive, and physical life is eternal because
we are going to see each other again after the PHYSICAL resurrection of
all PHYSICALLY dead people. And that physical resurrection is to never
die again physically because it is not possible to die physically, that
is what Jesus Christ affirms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, Jesus Christ saves us from death.</p>
<p>To make the concept clear from the biblical point of view, let us see
what the bible tells us.</p>
<h4 id="life_DOT_"><span id="anchor-93"></span>Life.</h4>
<p>In various parts of the gospels our Lord Jesus Christ, Yeshua, refers
to life:</p>
<p>In John 14 he says: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> am
the way, the truth, and the life<strong>" </strong><strong><a
href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In John 11 he states: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> am
the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die,
he shall live<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn136"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In John 8: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> am the light
of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the
light of life<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn137"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In John 6: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> am the bread
of life<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref138"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In John 17: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong>nd this is
eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus
Christ whom You have sent<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn139"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In short, Life, according to the bible in the voice of Jesus Christ,
is Himself, Jesus Christ, Yeshua. And as 1st John 2 says:</p>
<p><strong><strong>“</strong><strong>T</strong>he one who says ‘I have
come to know God’ and yet does not keep his commandments is a liar, and
the truth is not in such a person. <strong>B</strong>ut whoever obeys
his word, truly in this person the love of God has been perfected. By
this we know that we are in him. <strong>T</strong>he one who says he
resides in God ought himself to walk just as Jesus walked<strong>"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a></strong></strong>. That means:
loving.</p>
<p>This physical life that Jesus speaks of is eternal, it does not end
with physical death because it continues after the resurrection of the
dead. It is only interrupted.</p>
<p>Paul explains in Philippians 3 that Jesus Christ
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>ill transform these
humble bodies of ours into the likeness of his glorious body"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a></strong></strong>. That one who
ate roasted fish according to Luke 24, which can be touched, and which
went up to heaven and they saw him until a cloud covered him according
to Acts 1.</p>
<p>If that is believed, real life starts. People begin to live according
to what is believed. That physical life continues after resurrection and
that the way to STAY alive is to follow Yeshua, YHWH, through his Spirit
that lives in us, his Ruakh HaKodesh. To live as Yeshua lives. Loving.
Following the Law, the Precepts, the Commandments. Loving them to be
able to follow them. Doing what is good according to YHWH, not according
to my heart.</p>
<p>YHWH himself explains through his prophet Ezekiel that:</p>
<p><strong>"If the wicked person turns from all the sin he has committed
and observes all my statutes and does what is just and right, he will
surely live; he will <strong>NOT</strong> <strong>DIE</strong>. None of
the sins he has committed will be held against him; because of the
righteousness he has done, he <strong>WILL</strong>
<strong>LIVE</strong>. Do I actually delight in the death of the wicked,
declares the Sovereign Lord? Do I not prefer that he turn from his
wicked conduct and live?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But if a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and
practices wrongdoing according to all the abominable practices the
wicked carry out, will he live? All his righteous acts will not be
remembered; because of the unfaithful acts he has done and the sin he
has committed, he <strong>WILL DIE</strong>” <a href="#fn142"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>142</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>He who does good lives and he who does evil dies. To follow Christ,
to live as Yeshua lives, is to do what is good, is to be alive. Yeshua
is the Life. His Spirit gives us Life.</p>
<p>But it is impossible to live as Yeshua lives if it is believed that
he is dead, that He did not rise from the dead. That physical death is
the end.</p>
<p>If we believe that physical death is the end, we are still dead
spiritually, because according to the bible we are born to this physical
life spiritually dead. We are born without a relationship with the
Father. Relationship that only faith in Jesus Christ can begin.</p>
<p>If we believe that physical death is not the end, the transformation
of the mind has already begun, we are already born again to a spiritual
life and all things are made new.</p>
<p>Only the resurrection of Yeshua allows us to see the existence in the
second form because it is the only example of which there is authentic
evidence. The problem is that no one, absolutely no one, can make
someone believe the latter, only the Father can do that. Jesus Christ
himself explains it to us in John 6:
<strong><strong>”</strong><strong>No</strong><strong> one can come to me
unless the Father who sent me” </strong><strong><a href="#fn143"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a></strong><strong> “drags him first”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>144</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Some will only begin to believe in the resurrection of the dead AFTER
they have been resurrected. But it's always better to be alive than
dead.</p>
<h4 id="death_DOT_"><span id="anchor-94"></span>Death.</h4>
<p>Death is the absence of life, the non-existence of life. If death is
defined in this way, we can say that just as we have a physical life, an
emotional life, a mental life and, for those born in Christ, a spiritual
life, an eternal life, likewise we have a respective death for each
absence of each one of these kinds of life. A physical death, an
emotional death, a mental death and a spiritual death.</p>
<p>According to the bible, all descendants of Adam are born spiritually
dead. We are born without the spirit of Yeshua, who is Life itself. Who
gives us that spiritual life. Who gives us a relationship with the
Father.</p>
<p>According to the bible, when Jehovah created man he created him with
this relationship, alive not only physically but also spiritually, but
warned him <strong>“saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest
freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou
shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
surely die” <a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>145</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>According to John 8, Jesus Christ identifies his opponent, the Satan,
if we translate into hebrew, with the father of lies, with the murderer
from the beginning, with the devil. According to Matthew 23, with the
serpent and the viper <a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref146" role="doc-noteref"><sup>146</sup></a>. And according to
Revelation 20, with the dragon, the devil and the ancient serpent <a
href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The first serpent mentioned in the bible, that is, the father of the
lie and murderer from that beginning, that father of the Pharisees and
scribes who opposed Jesus Christ deceives Eve. He tells her:
<strong><strong>"</strong>Has God indeed said, ‘You shall not eat of
every tree of the garden’?<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn148"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a></strong></strong>. He exaggerates
what YHWH has said and then lies:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>ou will not surely
die. </strong><strong>F</strong><strong>or God knows that in the day you
eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing
good and evil” </strong><strong><a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref149"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Eve eats the fruit, Adam eats the fruit, and YHWH expels them from
Eden. They lose access to the Tree of Life, and what happens? They die.
They no longer have relationship with the Father, they can no longer eat
from the Tree of Life and die. They die spiritually and the consequence
of spiritual death is physical death. Maybe not immediately but it is
the end result. Adam ends up living 930 years and dies. He eventually
physically dies too. Spiritual death results in physical death.</p>
<p>The text of Genesis from the second chapter, fourth verse, change. It
stops using the word Elohim and starts using the word YHWH. The
narrative ceases to be strictly sequential, day by day, and becomes be
more generic and less chronological. More allegorical and less
literal.</p>
<p>But it can be read literally.</p>
<p>It is not difficult for a 21st century person to imagine a real snake
speaking if you have the technology to make it speak. Moses, according
to Jesus Christ, in John 5, was the one who wrote the text. And when
Moses wrote this, he had already seen bushes speak, and walking sticks
become serpents, and seas split in two, and bread fall from the sky for
months. So writing about a snake talking to a woman, was not a fairy
tale for Moses. If he really lived what he says he lived. And, if Jesus
Christ is alive because he was resurrected, the text was written by
Moses, it is true, and Moses lived what he said that he lived.</p>
<p>And, when YHWH speaks to the serpent, he is speaking to the one who
manipulated the snake. Similar to when Jesus speaks to the legion of
evil spirits that manipulated the man of the province of the Gadarenes,
according to Mark 5 <a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>150</sup></a>. To the man as such, Jesus only
speaks to him AFTER having expelled the unclean evil spirits.</p>
<p>In Genesis 3, YHWH says to the serpent:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>B</strong>ecause thou hast done this,
thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field;
upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
thy life<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a></strong></strong>.
Just as saying, since you think you are so much a snake, you're going to
BE one. He is telling it to the Satan, the father of liars. And from
then on he kept the title. Title that Jesus Christ uses with the
Pharisees who opposed him: serpents, vipers.</p>
<p>The text can be read literally if we can believe the context, if we
can believe that Moses lived what he said he lived. If we can imagine
the necessary technology. And if we do NOT think that we are smarter or
more evolved than the one who wrote it.</p>
<p>And according to Paul, everything is going according to plan. In 1
Corinthians 15 he tells us: <strong>“since by man came death, by Man
also came the resurrection of the dead” <a href="#fn152"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Yeshua brings us the resurrection. Yeshua is the Life. Yeshua saved
us from death.</p>
<p>It is NOT by AVOIDING death that He saves us, because we are born
spiritually dead and we are going to die physically anyways. It is by
TAKING US OUT of death that He saves us.</p>
<p>He first saves us from spiritual death by giving us Life through his
Holy Spirit. And then he will save us from physical death, when He will
resurrect us ALL on the last day. That is the order for the believer and
for the one that dies without believing is the inverse order.</p>
<h4 id="liberator_DOT_"><span id="anchor-95"></span>Liberator.</h4>
<p>According to John 8, Jesus Christ affirms that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>M</strong>ost assuredly, I say to you,
whoever commits sin is a <strong>SLAVE</strong> of sin<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a></strong></strong> and that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>f the Son sets you
</strong><strong>FREE</strong><strong>, you are truly
</strong><strong>FREE</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Paul also explains it in Romans 6: <strong>“Do you not know that if
you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you
obey, either of sin resulting in death, or obedience resulting in
righteousness?” <a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a></strong>. And he goes on to say,
<strong>"But now having been set free from sin, and having become slaves
of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life.
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in
Christ Jesus our Lord” <a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a></strong>. And he
adds in Romans 8 that <strong>“the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death” <a href="#fn157"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, Yeshua frees us from the power that sin has in us. It is a
power from which we cannot escape ourselves. Everyone realizes that we
are all sinners. We call it, quote, “the human condition”. We say,
quote: “everyone makes mistakes”.</p>
<p>Paul also explains it in Romans 7 saying: <strong>"I know that in me
(that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with
me, but how to perform what is good I do not find. For the good that I
will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice.
Now if I do what I will not to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin
that dwells in me” <a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a></strong>. And he adds: <strong>“O
wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? I
thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!" <a href="#fn159"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, we pass from a slavery to sin, from which we cannot get out by
ourselves, and is therefore forced, into a voluntary slavery to Jesus
Christ. If we willingly choose Jesus Christ as our Master, our King, our
Lord, is because we obey what he commands us: to love God above all
things, to love our neighbor as we love ourselves, and love each other
as Jesus Christ loves us.</p>
<p>The slavery allowed in the bible is not what we know as slavery
today. In Leviticus 19, YHWH commands the people of Israel:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong>hou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself: I am the <strong>Lord</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a></strong></strong>. And Jesus
Christ explains that the neighbor, in that law that orders to love the
neighbor, is anyone, even slaves. Those of which, in Galatians 4, Paul
says that: <strong><strong>"the heir, as long as he is a child, does not
differ at all from a slave” </strong><strong><a href="#fn161"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>161</sup></a></strong></strong>. Those who in
NOTHING differ from the child heir. Those of whom, according to
Deuteronomy 23, YHWH commands that: <strong><strong>"You shall
</strong><strong>NOT</strong><strong> give back to his master the slave
who has escaped from his master to you” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>162</sup></a></strong></strong>. Those who
actually belong to YHWH just as all of Israel and every creature on this
planet belongs to him. Those who, according to Exodus 21, should be set
free if by the master's fault loose an eye <a href="#fn163"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>163</sup></a>, and also, according to Leviticus
24, it would be done to the master as he did to the slave: an eye for an
eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for life <a href="#fn164"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In Jesus Christ ALL believers are made free from sin, not just
slaves, to freely become slaves of Jesus Christ. Paul explains in
Galatians 3: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>T</strong>here is neither
Jew nor greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male
nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a></strong></strong>. And in 1st
Corinthians 7 Paul explains that: he <strong><strong>“who is called in
the Lord while a </strong><strong>SLAVE</strong><strong> is the Lord’s
</strong><strong>FREEDMAN</strong><strong>. Likewise he who is called
while </strong><strong>FREE</strong><strong> is Christ’s
</strong><strong>SLAVE”</strong><strong> </strong><strong><a
href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>166</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>We are all equal in Christ Jesus: willingly slaves of Jesus Christ to
be TRULY FREE.</p>
<p>It is God who, through Yeshua, frees us from slavery to sin by
changing our hearts so that we freely become slaves of Jesus Christ and
obey his commandment of loving him above all things for our own
good.</p>
<h4 id="principalities-and-powers_DOT_"><span
id="anchor-96"></span>Principalities and powers.</h4>
<p>But let's remember that it all started when the serpent tricked Eve.
That serpent that the bible also calls the Satan. Word that it is just a
transliteration of the hebrew word that means “opposer”.</p>
<p>According to Job 1, the Satan was, at least in Job's day, a
“beni-haelohim”, a son of God <a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref167" role="doc-noteref"><sup>167</sup></a>. The Satan was a son
of Elohim, the one who created the heavens and the earth. The Satan was
a son of the creator. The hebrew words coded as H1121 and H430 of the
Strong's code, the words for “ben”, meaning “son”, and “elohim”, meaning
“God”, indicate so <a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>168</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Job 1 says that <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>n</strong>ow there
was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the
<strong>Lord</strong>, and Satan came also among them<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>169</sup></a></strong></strong>. Satan was like
the rest of the children of Elohim, like the angels. Those who have body
and spirit and relationship with Jehovah. Those who can speak eat, have
sex and are indistinguishable in appearance from a man, of a son of
Adam. The Satan even has a conversation with Jehovah.</p>
<p>Job 1 narrates that:</p>
<p><strong>“Yahweh said to Satan, ‘Where have you come
from?’</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, ‘From going back and
forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yahweh said to Satan, ‘Have you considered my servant, Job?
For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright
man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, ‘Does Job fear God for
nothing? Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and
around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his
hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But stretch out your
hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your
face.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yahweh said to Satan, ‘Behold, all that he has is in your
power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.’</strong></p>
<p><strong>So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh” <a
href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>170</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>That is, a dialogue similar to the one that Abraham had with YHWH,
that is, Jehovah, or God, according to Genesis 18 <a href="#fn171"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref171"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>171</sup></a>. And keep in mind that Satan and
company had already done tricks several times.</p>
<p>According to Genesis 6, apparently long before Job, some of these
children did not behave very well because: <strong><strong>"When men
began to multiply on the surface of the ground, and daughters were born
to them, God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they
took any that they wanted for themselves as wives” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>172</sup></a></strong></strong>. Y that
<strong><strong>"</strong></strong><span
id="anchor-97"></span><strong>God’s sons came in to men’s daughters and
had children with them<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn173"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>173</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>That is to say that the Satan and other sons of God began to have
sons with the daughters of men.</p>
<p>There would be no need to differentiate between "sons of God" and
"sons of men” if it were a cross between sons and daughters of men. Sons
of men with daughters of men was just what God wanted from a beginning,
that's why he said to Adam and Eve:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>B</strong>e fruitful, multiply, fill
the earth<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn174"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>174</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>No. The Satan not only deceived Eve, but there were also other little
children of Elohim who were carried away by lust, one of the Satan's
favorite themes, and things got complicated. These little children of
Elohim they end up crossing with the daughters of men, having children
with them.</p>
<p>Children who obviously cannot be called angels because they never
really were messengers of God but opponents of God. That's why the bible
does not refer to them as malakh, the hebrew word for angels or
messengers of YHWH, but as sons of Elohim. Rebellious sons who from the
beginning became opposed to the creation of Elohim.</p>
<p>The result of all this disobedience both in the earth as it is in
heaven was that, according to Genesis 6:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>Y</strong>ahweh saw that the
wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of
the thoughts of man’s heart was continually only evil<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>175</sup></a></strong></strong>. His creation
got spoiled.</p>
<p>And since He already knew about the little problem since before
creating man, He continued with the plan as it was before creation. And
He gave a hint. He did with Noah something similar to what He intended
to do definitively with Yeshua: a reboot. And He sent the famous global
flood.</p>
<p>The little problem obviously continued, because the final solution
was Yeshua.</p>
<p>A little while after Noah, apparently also many years before Job, the
influence and dominance of the Satan and company continued. Of course
without offspring on earth, but they kept messing with the sons of Adam.
The result was what the bible describes as the Tower of Babel. But that
now it is easier to locate as tower of Eridu. Because its remains are
found in what is now known as Eridu. Even using the famous search engine
and its mapping mechanism anyone can locate the site where they started
building the tower.</p>
<p>From that dominion and influence of the Satan and company, from the
slavery to sin, of the current world system, ONLY the Spirit of Yeshua
can set us free. The one that Yeshua left us after His resurrection. We
start to be free when we are born again. When we start to believe that
He is really alive because He was resurrected. He gives us the power to
fight these principalities and powers that wanted to see us eternally
dead. It is a battle that takes place in the heart and mind of every
believer.</p>
<p>Paul explains in Ephesians that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>o</strong>ur wrestling is not against
flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers,
against the world’s rulers of the darkness of this age, and against the
spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn176" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref176"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>176</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And 1 John 5 explains that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong>he whole world lies in the
power of the evil one<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn177"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref177"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>177</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And Yeshua explains in John 17 about his followers that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> have given them your word.
The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am
not of the world. <strong>I</strong> pray not that you would take them
from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.
<strong>T</strong>hey are not of the world even as I am not of the
world<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn178" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref178" role="doc-noteref"><sup>178</sup></a></strong></strong>.
Once someone begins to follow Yeshua, he ceases to be of the world, he
ceases to be under the bondage of sin. He is liberated by our liberator
and begins to have the power to fight principalities and heavenly
powers.</p>
<p>And Paul in Romans 8 tells us that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>n</strong>either death, nor life, nor
angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
powers, <strong>n</strong>or height, nor depth, nor any other created
thing will be able to separate us from God’s love which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn179"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref179"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>179</sup></a></strong></strong>. That is to say:
nothing, absolutely nothing can separate us from the love of Jesus
Christ. Which reminds me of Psalm 136. Go look it up.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1 speaks of the power of God and
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>he exceeding
greatness of his power toward us who believe”</strong></strong>. And he
adds that: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong>hich he worked in
Christ, when he raised him from the dead and made him to sit at his
right hand in the heavenly places, <strong>f</strong>ar above all rule,
authority, power, dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
this age, but also in that which is to come. <strong>H</strong>e put all
things in subjection under his feet<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn180" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref180"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>180</sup></a></strong></strong>. That is to say,
Satan and company are under the feet of the Holy Spirit who lives in all
true believers.</p>
<p>Colossians 2 explains that Yeshua, Jesus Christ,
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>s</strong>tripped the principalities
and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over
them<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn181" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref181"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>181</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>It is to be expected that nobody will be happy to be under somebody
else’s feet, and the Satan and company, those that the bible calls
celestial principalities and powers, were no exception. They thought
that the idea of Adam and offspring was a bad idea and opposed YHWH's
plan from the beginning. And they sought to damage it and tare it down
by any means.</p>
<p>But YHWH, who knows it all, counted on that from the beginning and
kept it to himself. Paul explains in Romans 16 that:
<strong><strong>“</strong>the revelation of the mystery kept secret
since the world began<strong>”</strong></strong>, that mystery has
<strong><strong>“n</strong><strong>ow made manifest”</strong></strong>
and <strong><strong>“made known to all nations”</strong></strong> with
Jesus Christ and his Resurrection. All according to
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>he prophetic
Scriptures”</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>“according to the
commandment of the everlasting God"</strong></strong>. And he ends by
saying that <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>o God,
alone wise, </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>glory through Jesus
Christ forever. </strong><strong>Amen</strong><strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>182</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>There are two kingdoms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the hearts and minds of believers in Yeshua, where the Holy
spirit of Yeshua reigns.</li>
<li>And in the hearts and minds of those who have not been born again,
where reign the spirits of the principalities and powers that are in
rebellion against the Creator, spirits that the bible calls evil and
impure, or demons.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yeshua HaMashiakh gives us His spirit to be able to fight the
heavenly principalities and powers.</p>
<h4 id="one-of-two_DOT_"><span id="anchor-98"></span>One of two.</h4>
<p>According to the bible, the person who does not believe in Yeshua is
spiritually dead. All those who do not follow Him, who do not live as He
taught, they are actually dead.</p>
<p>Jesus explains in John 5 that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>M</strong>ost certainly I tell you, he
who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life, and
doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into
life<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref183"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>183</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And in Matthew 8 someone says to him,
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>L</strong>ord, allow me first to go
and bury my father<strong>"</strong></strong> and Jesus replies:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>ollow me, and leave
the dead to bury their own dead" </strong><strong><a href="#fn184"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref184"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>184</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>He who does not know Jesus is dead. Dead to true life. To eternal
life.</p>
<p>Of course one has a physical life, an emotional life, an intellectual
or mental life, but one doesn't have an spiritual life, a transcendental
life, an eternal life. It ends with death. That is what one believes.
And one lives according to that. One is dead. There is no relationship
with the creator.</p>
<p>Paul explains in Ephesians 2 that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>y</strong>ou were dead in
transgressions and sins, <strong>i</strong>n which you once walked
according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the
power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of
disobedienc<strong>e</strong><strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn185"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref185"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>185</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, we were spiritually dead for being children of the
Satan, like some Pharisees of the time of Jesus.</p>
<p>But, what is that course of this world that those who disobey God
walk accordingly?</p>
<p>In 1 John 2 it says:</p>
<p><strong><strong>“</strong><strong>D</strong>on’t love the world or
the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the
Father’s love isn’t in him. <strong>F</strong>or all that is in the
world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of
life, isn’t the Father’s, but is the world’s. <strong>T</strong>he world
is passing away with its lusts, but he who does God’s will remains
forever<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref186"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>186</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In other words it is either the world or YHWH, there is no
middle.</p>
<p>According to John 10 Yeshua affirms that to his sheep, to those who
believe in Him:</p>
<p><strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> give them eternal life,
and they will never perish; no one will snatch them from my
hand<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref187"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>187</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And according to John 6 Jesus states:</p>
<p><strong><strong>“</strong><strong>E</strong>veryone whom the Father
gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never send
away<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref188"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>188</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And in John 6 he also states: <strong>"Now this is the will of the
one who sent me: that I should not lose one person of every one he has
given me, but raise them all up at the LAST day"</strong>. And he
reaffirms: <strong>"For this is the will of my Father: for everyone who
looks on the Son and believes in him to have eternal life, and I will
raise him up at the LAST day" <a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref189" role="doc-noteref"><sup>189</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, first the Father gives them to Him and then nobody
takes them away nor He throws them out. And the thing continues is at
the end, on the LAST day. Not before.</p>
<h4 id="sleeping_DOT_"><span id="anchor-99"></span>Sleeping.</h4>
<p>And in the meanwhile?</p>
<p>Well, according to John 11, Jesus Christ affirms that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>O</strong>ur friend, Lazarus, has
fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out of
sleep<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref190" role="doc-noteref"><sup>190</sup></a></strong></strong>
and then explains
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>L</strong><strong>azarus is dead"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>191</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And according to Mark 5 and Luke 8 Yeshua affirms:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>S</strong>he isn’t dead, but
sleeping<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref192"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>192</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, in the meantime, the body becomes dust in the grave
and the spirit asleep with the one who never sleeps, YHWH, who watches
over it.</p>
<p>According to Ecclesiastes 9 in that sleep,
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong>here is no work, nor plan,
nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in Sheol, where you are going<strong>"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn193" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref193"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>193</sup></a></strong></strong>. And
Ecclesiastes 12, refers to death, as the moment when
<strong><strong>“the dust RETURNS to the earth as it WAS, and the spirit
RETURNS to God who GAVE it” </strong><strong><a href="#fn194"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref194"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>194</sup></a></strong></strong>. Things go back
to the way they were BEFORE they were alive: the dust turned to dust and
the spirit with God. That's why there are no works, one can do nothing,
no plans, there is nothing to plan, no knowledge, nothing can be known,
not even God. And the thing remains like that until Jesus Christ rises
them, awakens them, that is why Paul in 1st Corinthians 11 tells us that
some are sleeping <a href="#fn195" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref195"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>195</sup></a>, something that is still going on,
that is what the conjugation of the greek word G2837 indicates.</p>
<p>The comparison of Jesus Christ has two parts. One refers to the fact
that when someone sleeps there is no consciousness, one can’t do
anything. The other refers to the fact that the person can be wakened
up. It is not an irreversible situation. And god can wake people up
temporarily to go back to sleep later or He can do it permanently as in
not to going back to sleep ever again, just as He promises to do it on
the LAST day.</p>
<p>In the bible we have several examples of people who were temporarily
awakened, even for times longer than what Adam lived. According to John
21 when He says to Peter: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong>f
I desire that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow
me<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn196" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref196" role="doc-noteref"><sup>196</sup></a></strong></strong>.
Situation that becomes real when Peter, according to Luke 9, tells Jesus
Christ: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>M</strong><strong>aster, it is
good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for
Moses, and one for Elijah” </strong><strong><a href="#fn197"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref197"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>197</sup></a></strong></strong>. Peter offers to
build 3 tabernacles, or tents, because they were in the Jewish festival
of Sukot, 2 of them for Moses and Elijah, event commonly known as the
transfiguration of Jesus Christ. They were physically present and so
Peter offers to build two tents and use them to celebrate Sukkot.</p>
<p>But the first to obtain a definitive physical resurrection, one that
it is to not die again, because you can no longer die, it is Jesus
Christ. Paul explains in Colossians 1 that Jesus Christ
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>i</strong>s the beginning, the
firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the
preeminence<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn198"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref198"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>198</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ sleeps for 3 days and three nights to fulfill the
scriptures, before waking up, before resurrection. That's why the
promise that Jesus Christ makes to the thief who was crucified with him
when he tells him that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong>ssuredly I tell you, today
you will be with me in Paradise<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn199" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref199"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>199</sup></a></strong></strong> refers to a
future moment but not an immediate one, because the next three days and
three nights Jesus Christ was going to be asleep in Sheol, which is no
paradise. </p>
<p>In koine greek there are no commas, and the word “today” was used to
make emphasis, so the word “today” refers to that precise instant and
NOT to the moment the thief will be with Jesus in Paradise.</p>
<p>It is possible that said thief is one of those that Matthew 27 speaks
to us about when says that: <strong>"The tombs were opened, and many
BODIES of the saints who had fallen ASLEEP were RAISED; and COMING
<strong>out</strong> of the tombs AFTER his resurrection,
<strong>they</strong> <strong>entered</strong> into the holy city and
<strong>APPEARED</strong> to many” <a href="#fn200" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref200" role="doc-noteref"><sup>200</sup></a></strong>, but the
bible does not specify it. What shows us this passage is that the dead
are asleep, unconscious, and they can only COME and APPEAR to the living
AFTER they RAISE from the graves, when they cease to be ASLEEP, when
they wake up, when they are RISEN, when they resurrect with a physical
BODY, be it temporary or definitely. Not before.</p>
<p>Paul in 2nd Corinthians 5 explains the resurrection, that moment in
which we will be awakened to be in the presence of Jesus Christ, with a
comparison. He says: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong>e know
that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved, we have a building
from God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
<strong>F</strong>or most certainly in this we groan, longing to be
clothed with our habitation which is from heaven<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>201</sup></a></strong></strong>. Paul compares
this body to a temporary house that will be replaced by a permanent one
that was made in heaven. This body will be replaced by a permanent body
to inhabit a new earth with new heavens. But in the meanwhile we will be
sleeping.</p>
<h4 id="everyone_DOT_"><span id="anchor-100"></span>Everyone.</h4>
<p>And how am I born to that eternal life? It is not so easy because
according to John 6 Jesus Christ affirms: <strong>”<strong>No</strong>
one can come to me unless the Father who sent me<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>202</sup></a></strong><strong> “drags him first”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>203</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And Jesus Christ explains in John 14:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>N</strong>o one comes to the Father,
except through me<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn204"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>204</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, first the Father gives them to Jesus Christ and then
through that way we reach the Father.</p>
<p>So we are in the hands of YHWH. Of the Father.</p>
<p>But there is good news because according to John 5, our Lord Yeshua
states:</p>
<p><strong>“Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes in which all who
are in the tombs will hear his voice, and will come out; those who have
done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to
the resurrection of” <a href="#fn205" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref205"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>205</sup></a> “judgment” <a href="#fn206"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref206"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>206</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Paul explains in 1 Timothy 2 that God
<strong><strong>“</strong>desires <strong>ALL</strong> people to be
saved and come to full knowledge of the truth<strong>"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn207" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref207"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>207</sup></a></strong></strong> and that Jesus
Christ <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>ho gave
himself as a ransom for </strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong>, the
testimony in its own times" </strong><strong><a href="#fn208"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref208"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>208</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And in 1 Corinthians 15 Paul explains that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong>or as in Adam
<strong>ALL</strong> die, even so in Christ <strong>ALL</strong> shall
be made alive<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn209"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref209"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>209</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Because as explained in Romans 11: <strong><strong>“</strong>God has
committed them <strong>ALL</strong> to disobedience, that He might have
mercy on <strong>ALL</strong><strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn210"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref210"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>210</sup></a></strong></strong> and that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>or of Him and
through Him and to Him </strong><strong>are ALL</strong><strong> things,
to whom </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>glory forever. Amen"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn211" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref211"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>211</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And Jesus Christ in Matthew 11 says that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>ALL</strong> things have been
delivered to Me by My Father<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn212"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref212"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>212</sup></a></strong></strong>. And in John 17
he affirms that: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>y</strong><strong>ou
gave him authority over </strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> flesh, so
he will give eternal life to </strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> whom
you have given him" </strong><strong><a href="#fn213"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref213"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>213</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And John in Revelation 5 says that: <strong>"And
<strong>EVERY</strong> creature which is in heaven, and on the earth,
and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and
<strong>ALL</strong> that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and
honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne,
and unto the Lamb for ever and ever" <a href="#fn214"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref214"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>214</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>And Paul quotes Isaiah 45 in Romans 14 saying,
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong>s I live, saith the Lord,
<strong>EVERY</strong> knee shall bow to me, and <strong>EVERY</strong>
tongue shall confess to God<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn215"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref215"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>215</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Let us hope that at least after the resurrection of the dead and
during that <strong>“<strong>ETERNAL JUDGMENT</strong>”</strong> <a
href="#fn216" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref216"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>216</sup></a> that awaits those who did evil,
all those "ALL" include you ; and Elohim, YHWH, the creator of heaven
and earth, doesn't end up being a liar.</p>
<h3 id="just_DOT_"><span id="anchor-101"></span>Just.</h3>
<p>The justice described in the bible may be one of the most difficult
concepts to understand or one of the easiest to understand.</p>
<p>It all depends on what we believe before reading the text.</p>
<p>If we believe that physical death IS the end, that there is no
physical resurrection of the dead, it is very difficult to understand.
But if we believe that physical death is NOT the end and that there IS a
physical resurrection of the dead, of ALL the dead, and we read the text
letting the text itself to define the concepts of good, bad, obedience,
disobedience, life and death, it is very easy to understand.</p>
<h4 id="justice_DOT_"><span id="anchor-102"></span>Justice.</h4>
<p>YHWH himself explains through his prophet Ezekiel that:</p>
<p><strong>“If the wicked person turns from all the sin he has committed
and observes all my statutes and does what is just and right, he will
surely live; he will not die. None of the sins he has committed will be
held against him; because of the righteousness he has done, he will
live. Do I actually delight in the death of the wicked, declares the
Sovereign Lord? Do I not prefer that he turn from his wicked conduct and
live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>But if a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and
practices wrongdoing according to all the abominable practices the
wicked carry out, will he live? All his righteous acts will not be
remembered; because of the unfaithful acts he has done and the sin he
has committed, he will die” <a href="#fn217" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref217" role="doc-noteref"><sup>217</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>It’s easy: He who does good lives. He who does evil dies.</p>
<p>YHWH also explains his justice through Moses. In Deuteronomy 30 tells
us that: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>S</strong>ee, I have set
before thee this day life and good, and death and evil<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn218" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref218"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>218</sup></a></strong></strong>. And He also
says: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong><strong> call heaven
and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you
life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn219" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref219"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>219</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah 17 also YHWH says that: <strong>"The heart is deceitful
above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the Lord
search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to
his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings” <a href="#fn220"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref220"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>220</sup></a></strong>. And a little later in
Jeremiah 18: <strong>“<strong>i</strong>f that nation, against whom I
have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I
thought to do unto them. And at what instant I shall speak concerning a
nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; If it do
evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the
good, wherewith I said I would benefit them" <a href="#fn221"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref221"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>221</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, the thing works for people as well as for nations. If
you do what is good, you live; if you do what is bad, you die.</p>
<h4 id="the-good-guy_DOT_"><span id="anchor-103"></span>The good guy.</h4>
<p>The question is who does good?</p>
<p>When the rich young man addresses Jesus Christ as "good teacher" in
Mark 10, Jesus Christ asks him:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>W</strong>hy do you call me good? No
one is good except one: God<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn222"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref222"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>222</sup></a></strong></strong>. Consistent with
Paul's explanation in Romans 11:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>or God has bound
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> to disobedience, that he might
have mercy on </strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong>" </strong><strong><a
href="#fn223" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref223"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>223</sup></a></strong></strong>. And with 1st
Corinthians 15 in which Paul explains that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>or as in Adam
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> die, so also in Christ
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> will be made alive"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn224" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref224"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>224</sup></a></strong></strong>. And with Psalm
14 which says: <strong><strong>“The Lord looked down from heaven upon
the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and
seek God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:
there is none that doeth good, no, not one” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn225" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref225"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>225</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Thus, according to the bible, sinners, those who do evil, it is ALL
of us, absolutely everyone since Adam and the consequence is death.
Precisely for this reason we ALL need a savior. Among men there is no
good one, not even one.</p>
<p>And what was that so terrible that Adam did?</p>
<p>In Genesis 3, God tells Adam: <strong>"of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it
you shall surely die” <a href="#fn226" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref226" role="doc-noteref"><sup>226</sup></a></strong>. From the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Seeking to know good and
evil.</p>
<p>From a strictly logical, strictly rational, point of view, it is
impossible to distinguish the good from the bad without knowing the
truth. If I do not know the truth, if I don't have access to the truth,
how can I distinguish good from bad? Impossible.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ identifies himself as The Truth. He says in John 14
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> am the way, the truth, and
the life<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn227" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref227" role="doc-noteref"><sup>227</sup></a></strong></strong>.
Thus without The Truth, without Jesus Christ, it is impossible to
distinguish between good and bad. That is why Jesus Christ tells us,
according to John 8, that: <strong><strong>“If you remain in my word,
then you are truly my disciples. You will know the truth, and the truth
will make you free” </strong><strong><a href="#fn228"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref228"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>228</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>If we do not know Jesus Christ, if we do not know The Truth, we are
not TRULY free. It is possible to choose, to decide, but it is not
possible choose CORRECTLY. You are not truly free. You are a slave to a
lie. That physical death is the end. That there is no physical
resurrection. We are slaves to sin, we can only "err the objective”, we
are not TRULY free.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem like it, but without Jesus Christ it happens to us
what happened to the people of Israel in the time of the Judges.
According to Judges 21, when already having the commandments and all the
law of the Torah, <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>e</strong>very man
did that which was right in his own eyes<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn229" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref229"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>229</sup></a></strong></strong>. And without
Jesus Christ, it still happens to us. When is abortion good? When is it
good to change gender? Is homosexual marriage good? Was YHWH good in
sending Shaul to kill all the people of Amalek? Is the law written in
Deuteronomy good? Why doesn't it ban slavery? We choose, we judge,
without The Truth, without Jesus Christ in the heart, and we end up
doing the same thing of Judges 21:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>very man did that
which was right in his own eyes” </strong><strong><a href="#fn230"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref230"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>230</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And what we believe as true, as certain, as real, determines the way
we think, speak and act. Our priorities, wishes and objectives are
aligned with what we believe. That is why John explains in 1st John 2
that: <strong>“Don’t love the world or the things that are in the world.
If anyone loves the world, the Father’s love isn’t in him. For all that
is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the
pride of life, isn’t the Father’s, but is the world’s” <a href="#fn231"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref231"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>231</sup></a></strong>. Pleasure, money and
social power are the priorities of those who belong to the world. Those
priorities change when we know Jesus Christ, the Truth himself. That's
why Yeshua also says in John 11 that: <strong>"I am the resurrection and
the life” <a href="#fn232" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref232"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>232</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>When you begin to believe in his resurrection, things begin to
change. Paul explains in Romans 10 that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>i</strong>f you will confess with your
mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him
from the dead, you will be saved<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn233" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref233"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>233</sup></a></strong></strong>. Believe IN THE
HEART, not from the mouth to the outside, that Jesus Christ was
resurrected, allows the process to begin.</p>
<h4 id="doing-good_DOT_"><span id="anchor-104"></span>Doing good.</h4>
<p>Doing good seems very easy, Jesus Christ explains it, according to
Matthew 22: <strong>“You shall love the Lord your God with all your
heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and
great commandment. A second likewise is this, You shall love your
neighbor as yourself. The whole law and the prophets depend on these two
commandments” <a href="#fn234" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref234"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>234</sup></a></strong>. And he adds, according
to John 13: <strong>“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one
another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another” <a
href="#fn235" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref235"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>235</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>It looks easy. Love God above all things, love your neighbor as
yourself, love as Yeshua loves us. Easy. Love, love, love.</p>
<p>To do good is to love.</p>
<p>It is in practice that things are not so easy because according to
Matthew 5, Yeshua makes it a little more difficult than what was written
by Moses. Yeshua says that <strong>“You have heard that it was said to
the ancient ones, ‘You shall not murder;’ and ‘Whoever murders will be
in danger of the judgment.’ But I tell you that everyone who is angry
with his brother without a cause will be in danger of the judgment.
Whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ will be in danger of the council.
Whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of Gehenna“ <a
href="#fn236" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref236"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>236</sup></a></strong>. And he adds:
<strong>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit
adultery’ ; but I tell you that everyone who gazes at a woman to lust
after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart” <a
href="#fn237" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref237"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>237</sup></a></strong>. Meaning that we sin with
what we say, with our thoughts, with our feelings, with our heart. It's
not just what we do. It is what comes out from the heart. Yeshua
explains in Matthew 15 that: <strong>“the things which proceed out of
the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. For out of the
heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts,
false testimony, and blasphemies” <a href="#fn238" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref238" role="doc-noteref"><sup>238</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Yeshua demands more than the law written by Moses. According to
Matthew 5, Yeshua demands loving the enemy, turning the other cheek,
giving anything they ask for, go the extra mile, be like the Heavenly
Father who is perfect. To be Holy.</p>
<p>To be good is to be Holy and Perfect like the Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>Now, those are big words. That is why Yeshua says that he did not
come to cancel the law but to complete it. To make it even more
perfect.</p>
<p>That is why Peter asks him <strong>"Who then can be saved?"</strong>,
and Yeshua replies: <strong>"With men this is impossible, but with God
all things are possible” <a href="#fn239" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref239" role="doc-noteref"><sup>239</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<h4 id="the-bad-guys_DOT_"><span id="anchor-105"></span>The bad guys.</h4>
<p>The good is God. To do good is to love as God loves, to be Holy and
Perfect.</p>
<p>We have all sinned, we all have sin within ourselves. All men have
done evil.</p>
<p>And according to the bible, what happens to the one who does evil?
What happens to bad people? They die. In fact they are already dead. It
is precisely because they are spiritually dead, for not knowing Yeshua,
who is Life itself, for not being able to live as Jesus Christ lived,
that they cannot do what is good. And the consequence of spiritual death
is physical death. That was the consequence for Adam and that is the
fate of sinners, of all Adam's descendants.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few people of the last generation descendant
from Adam, we are ALL going to physically die. Because there is sin in
EVERYONE. It is within the flesh itself. In genetics itself. That one
that comes from Adam. There is a physical propagation of evil, through
the flesh, and a spiritual propagation, through the social system, what
the bible calls the world. That is why the bible speaks of a creation in
collapse, a fallen creation. Spiritual death is nullable when you begin
to spiritually know Jesus Christ. And physical death will be nullable
AFTER the resurrection of the dead. Jesus Christ saves us from death by
TAKING US OUT of death, both physical and spiritual.</p>
<p>Psalm 37 says that the wicked wither, that they will be cut off, that
they will be no more, that you will look for them and will not find
them, that their day comes, that their sword will enter their own
hearts, that their arms will be broken, that they will perish, that they
vanish like smoke, that they will be destroyed <a href="#fn240"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref240"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>240</sup></a>. Obviously that has not happened
yet. There are still a lot of bad guys out there.</p>
<p>Psalm 9 has a similar tone, it speaks of the destruction of the
wicked forever and ever. Other psalms calling for or announcing
destruction of the wicked are Psalm 10, 12, 18, 21, 28, 52, 58, 59, 63,
73, 92. In short, there are several psalms that speak of the destruction
of the wicked.</p>
<p>There are several psalms in which the psalmist asks God for physical
suffering of the wicked. Some in tones of revenge and torture. Which
shows us that even psalmists saw themselves as good people, the bad guys
are the others, and that, according to the bible, it is valid to ask
practically anything to God. Including the suffering of other people or
the death of oneself. It is valid as long as God is asked for it and it
is not thought about taking actions by yourself. Leaving things in the
hands of God's justice.</p>
<p>There are several passages in the book of Revelation that talk about
the destruction of the wicked.</p>
<p>Revelation 11, just after blowing the seventh trumpet, tells us that:
<strong>“The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time
for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets,
their reward, as well as to the saints, and those who fear your name, to
the small and the great, and to <strong>DESTROY</strong> those who
destroy the earth” <a href="#fn241" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref241"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>241</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In Revelation 20 when it says that: <strong>“And after the thousand
years, Satan will be released from his prison, and he will come out to
deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and
Magog, to gather them together to the war; the number of whom is as the
sand of the sea. They went up over the width of the earth, and
surrounded the camp of the saints, and the beloved city. Fire came down
out of heaven from God and devoured them” <a href="#fn242"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref242"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>242</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Revelation 21 says that: <strong>“But for the cowardly, unbelieving,
sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters,
and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and
sulfur, which is the second death” <a href="#fn243" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref243" role="doc-noteref"><sup>243</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>The point is that God promises to destroy the wicked. That the day
will come when you will look for them and will not find them.</p>
<h4 id="fire_DOT_"><span id="anchor-106"></span>Fire.</h4>
<p>YHWH's, God's, favorite way of ending the bad guys is with fire.</p>
<p>In Genesis 19 it says that: <strong><strong>“Then Yahweh rained on
Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and </strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong>
from Yahweh out of the sky” </strong><strong><a href="#fn244"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref244"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>244</sup></a></strong></strong>. In Ezekiel 38:
<strong><strong>“I will rain on him, and on his hordes, and on the many
peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower, with great hailstones,
</strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong>, and sulfur” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn245" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref245"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>245</sup></a></strong></strong>. In Amos 1 and 2
we see that Jehovah says that: <strong><strong>“I will send a
</strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong> into the house of
Hazael”</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>“I will send a
</strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong> on the wall of
Gaza”</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>“I will send a
</strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong> on the wall of
Tyrus”</strong></strong>, and <strong><strong>“I will send a
</strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong> upon Teman”</strong></strong>,
and <strong><strong>“I will send a
</strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong> upon Moab”</strong></strong>, and
<strong><strong>“I will send a </strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong>
upon Judah”</strong></strong>. In Revelation 20 says that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong> came down out of
heaven from God </strong><strong>and devoured them” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn246" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref246"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>246</sup></a></strong></strong>. Revelation 21
says that: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong>he fearful, and
unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and
sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the
lake which burneth with <strong>FIRE</strong> and brimstone: which is
the second death<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn247"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref247"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>247</sup></a></strong></strong>. In 2nd Peter 2
says that: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>ut the
heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in
store, reserved unto </strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong> against the
day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn248" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref248"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>248</sup></a></strong></strong>. Definitely God
likes fire. And sometimes sulfur and brimstone.</p>
<p>The bible also tells us in 1st John 4 that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>H</strong>e who doesn’t love doesn’t
know God, for God is love<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn249"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref249"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>249</sup></a></strong></strong>. And in Hebrews
12: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>or our God is a
consuming fire” </strong><strong><a href="#fn250" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref250" role="doc-noteref"><sup>250</sup></a></strong></strong>.
Which means that God is love and fire at the same time.</p>
<p>And according to Isaiah 9 Jehovah declares that <strong>“for the
passion of YHWH <strong>tzabaot the whole</strong> earth is on fire and
the peoples are the fuel. Fire from man to brother leaving no one” <a
href="#fn251" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref251"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>251</sup></a></strong>. ALL the earth. And the
PEOPLE are THE FUEL. And the fire spreads from man to brother! Just as
saying: TREMENDOUS FIRE!</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that this is perfectly consistent with the
intentions that Yeshua says he has in Luke 12 when he states that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> came to throw
<strong>FIRE</strong> on the earth. I wish it were already
kindled<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn252" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref252" role="doc-noteref"><sup>252</sup></a></strong></strong>.
And with Mark 9 when Yeshua states:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>or everyone will be
salted with </strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn253" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref253"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>253</sup></a></strong></strong>. Which means
that the pyromaniac is Jesus Christ!</p>
<h5 id="spiritual_DOT_"><span id="anchor-107"></span>Spiritual.</h5>
<p>John the Baptist, according to Matthew 3, explains to us about Jesus
Christ that: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>H</strong>e will baptize
you in the Holy Spirit. <strong>H</strong>is winnowing fork is in his
hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor. He will gather
his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable
<strong>FIRE</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn254"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref254"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>254</sup></a></strong></strong>. In a FIRE that
will NEVER go out. Jehovah, in Malachi 3, warns us:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>ho can endure the
day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a
refiner’s </strong><strong>FIRE</strong><strong>, and like launderers’
soap” </strong><strong><a href="#fn255" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref255"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>255</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ himself tells us about the Valley of Hinnom, the Ge
Hinom in hebrew, the Ge-Henna in the greek transliteration. Translated
“INFERNO” in latin and then “INFIERNO” in spanish, also translated into
germanic languages as “hel” or “helle” and later translated into english
as “HELL”. A valley where in the times of King Josiah, the hebrews, the
Israelites, sacrificed their children by passing them through fire to
some god Moloch <a href="#fn256" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref256"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>256</sup></a>. Using said valley as a reference,
Jesus Christ tells us according to Matthew 5 that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>W</strong>hoever says, ‘You fool!’
will be in danger of the <strong>FIRE</strong> of Gehenna”<strong>
</strong><strong><a href="#fn257" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref257"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>257</sup></a></strong></strong>, and that:
<strong><strong>“everyone who gazes at a woman to lust after her has
committed adultery with her already in his heart. If your right eye
causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. For it
is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish than
for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn258" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref258"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>258</sup></a></strong></strong>. And according
to Matthew 18, Jesus Christ says that said fire is ETERNAL <a
href="#fn259" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref259"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>259</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Son, Jesus Christ, also likes fire to put an end to the bad guys.
And not just any fire but an ETERNAL one. And if you gaze greedily:
already trouble.</p>
<p>Jehovah, YHWH, the Father, according to Isaiah 33, says that:
<strong>“Now I will arise, says Yahweh. Now I will lift myself up. Now I
will be exalted. You will conceive chaff. You will give birth to
stubble. Your breath is a <strong>FIRE</strong> that will devour you.
The peoples will be like the burning of lime, like thorns that are cut
down and burned in the <strong>FIRE</strong>. Hear, you who are far off,
what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might. The
sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless ones. Who
among us can live with the devouring <strong>FIRE</strong>? Who among us
can live with everlasting burning?” <a href="#fn260"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref260"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>260</sup></a></strong>. No one wants to live in
the middle of a fire that does not go out. Especially the bad guys.</p>
<p>And according to Jude 1 the thing has already started because it
speaks of the non-believers of the time in the following terms:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>a</strong>nd some save, snatching them
out of the <strong>FIRE</strong> with fear, hating even the clothing
stained by the flesh<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn261"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref261"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>261</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>On the one hand we have that the Holy Spirit is like a fire, that
consumes everything, which is love, which is transmitted from believer
to non-believer, which will never go out, that burns all peoples and
nations, that transforms the person, which cleanses the person like a
purifying fire, or like bleach that removes stains, that the bad guys
are filled with fear and tremble to think of it, that Jesus Christ was
the one who brought it and that he is going to set the whole earth on
fire. One way to end the bad guys is by turning them into good guys
through his Holy Spirit. Starting off of a creature that does evil God
makes a new creature that does good, transforming the first into the
second through its Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that this fire of the Holy Spirit is one that will
never go out, a fire that is eternal.</p>
<h5 id="physical_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-108"></span>Physical.</h5>
<p>On the other hand we have that Sodom and Gomorrah were not consumed
by a spiritual fire, but by a physical one. A physical fire was the one
that also consumed Tyre, Bozrah, Kerioth, and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And the fire that Peter talks about in 2nd Peter 3 when he says that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>B</strong>ut the heavens that exist
now and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for
<strong>FIRE</strong>, being reserved against the day of judgment and
destruction of ungodly men<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn262"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref262"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>262</sup></a></strong></strong>, is a fire that
seems to be very physical because he compares the situation with what
happened in times of Noah. Situation that was definitely very
physical.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Peter says that: <strong>“But the day of the Lord will
come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens will pass away with a
great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and
the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore
since all these things will be destroyed like this, what kind of people
ought you to be in holy living and godliness, looking for and earnestly
desiring the coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning
heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?
But, according to <strong>H</strong>is promise, we look for new heavens
and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells” <a href="#fn263"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref263"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>263</sup></a></strong>. Elements dissolved,
works of the earth burned up, molten elements with heat, and then a new
earth with a new heavens. It cannot be said clearer. Something very
physical happens that ends everything by fire, not by water, so as not
to break the promise that God made to Noah.</p>
<p>If what is described in Isaiah 30 is physical when it says that:
<strong><strong>“</strong>the light of the moon will be like the light
of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like
the light of seven days<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn264"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref264"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>264</sup></a></strong></strong>, it is easily
understandable how this entire planet is consumed by the fire. If the
moon becomes like the sun and the sun increases its energy 7 times this
planet becomes a ball of fire. And the prophecy of Zephaniah 1 would be
literal: <strong><strong>"I will utterly sweep away everything from the
surface of the earth, says Yahweh. I will sweep away man and animal. I
will sweep away the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and the heaps
of rubble with the wicked. I will cut off man from the surface of the
earth, says Yahweh” </strong><strong><a href="#fn265"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref265"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>265</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>This moment would be the moment when all of Adam’s offspring is
finished. No more sons of sons of sons of Adam. This would be the time
in which a few will not physically die because they will be directly
transformed, according to Paul in 1 Corinthians 15 <a href="#fn266"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref266"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>266</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This moment would correspond to the one described in Revelation 20
when, speaking of the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ on earth, it
says that: <strong>“And after the thousand years, Satan will be released
from his prison, and he will come out to deceive the nations which are
in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together
to the war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. They went up
over the width of the earth, and surrounded the camp of the saints, and
the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven from God and devoured
them” <a href="#fn267" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref267"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>267</sup></a></strong>. would correspond because
after that you don't see this earth with these heavens again but a new
earth and new heavens. New physical heavens and a new physical earth,
because the spiritual ones are already being built with all the born
again believers. Those who are going to live in that new earth with that
new heavens, also physical, when they are physically resurrected.</p>
<p>Moment also described in Ezekiel 38, when he says that Gog will say
to himself: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> will go to
those who are at rest, who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without
walls, and having neither bars nor gates<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn268" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref268"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>268</sup></a></strong></strong>. And that in the
end everything ends with:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>verflowing shower,
with great hailstones, fire, and sulfur” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn269" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref269"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>269</sup></a></strong></strong>. Just like it
all ends in Revelation 20. It makes sense that if there is a thousand
years of peace, of tranquility, in which one lives confidently, there
will be no walls nor locks.</p>
<p>Moment that is the end, end, of the children, of the children, of the
children of Adam. It doesn't go anymore. No more offspring of Adam.
Moment that is right before the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>We can conclude that God also likes physical fire to end with the bad
guys. Of course, none of the physical fires mentioned in the bible, and
that we know are physical ones, have been eternal. Every single one has
finished. They have all turned off.</p>
<h3 id="all-flesh_DOT_"><span id="anchor-109"></span>All flesh.</h3>
<p>By now it should be clear that, to the best of my knowledge, the
bible teaches that, after the resurrection of the dead, when ALL dead
are resurrected in a new PHYSICAL earth with a new PHYSICAL heaven, on
this very planet, ALL, absolutely ALL risen will be able to confess with
their mouth that Yeshua is Lord, and believe in their hearts that Yeshua
was resurrected, they have Him right in front of them, and therefore, it
may take a while, but sooner or later, those who did not start before
their physical death, will begin to be new creatures in Jesus Christ and
their eternal Life will begin.</p>
<p>One of the doctrines most rejected by most believers in Yeshua, in
Jesus Christ, is the doctrine commonly known as “Christian
universalism”. In this presentation it will be called simply “absolute
reconciliation”.</p>
<p>The way I understand the teachings of the bible is a way of absolute
reconciliation. And since it generates so much rejection, and it is so
emphatically pointed out by some as contrary to scripture, I think it is
necessary to make an analysis of the reasons why I believe that it is
exactly what the bible teaches.</p>
<h4 id="hell_DOT_"><span id="anchor-110"></span>Hell.</h4>
<p>The word "hell" does not appear anywhere in the oldest manuscripts
because these are written in hebrew and greek. And this word is neither
greek nor hebrew.</p>
<h5 id="jesus-christ_DOT_"><span id="anchor-111"></span>Jesus Christ.</h5>
<p>In the Gospels there are only two greek words which, in the words of
Jesus Christ, have been translated as "hell": The word G86, the “Hades”,
and the word G1067, the “Ge-Henna”, according to the code of Mr James
Strong.</p>
<h6 id="hades_DOT_-code-g86_DOT_"><span id="anchor-112"></span>Hades. Code
G86.</h6>
<p>The word G86 sounds "hadés", although many people pronounce it
“hádes”, and refers to the place where the dead go. The translation to
the greek of the old testament, of the Tanakh, of the hebrew scriptures,
known as the Septuagint, a translation made by hebrews between 300 and
200 before Jesus Christ, uses this word, the "hadés", to translate the
hebrew word “Sheol” into greek.</p>
<p>The word "Sheol", the word H7585, means the place where the dead
people go, that is the tomb, the sepulchre, the grave, or the pit.</p>
<p>"Grave" or "pit" is precisely the most frequent translation into
english in the Geneva. Of the 60 ocurrences of the word H7585 in the
Tanakh, more than 37 occurrences are translated in this way. Well, the
actual translation is ‘graue’, with an ‘u’, because it’s old english.
But you get the idea.</p>
<p>Then the most appropriate translation of the greek word "Hades" would
be the word: "grave”, unless you mean the pagan idea of the greeks of an
underworld where the greek god Hades reigns, in which case, the ideal
would be a transliteration of the word.</p>
<h6 id="ge-henna_DOT_-code-g1067_DOT_"><span id="anchor-113"></span>Ge-Henna.
Code G1067.</h6>
<p>The greek word G1067 sounds "Ge-Henna" and is a transliteration of
the hebrew “Ge Hinom” to greek. "Ge" means valley and "Hinom" is a
proper name. According to 2 Kings 23 and Jeremiah 7, in the time of King
Josiah, the hebrews, the Israelites, came sacrificing their children in
the valley of Hinnom passing them through fire to a certain god Moloch,
and Josiah, who according to the bible was a good king, he finished the
problem.</p>
<p>Then the most appropriate translation of the greek word "Ge-Henna"
would be the phrase: “Valley of Hinnom” or just a transliteration of the
word.</p>
<h4 id="sheol_DOT_-code-h7585_DOT_"><span id="anchor-114"></span>Sheol. Code
H7585.</h4>
<p>The first of the two greek words used by Jesus Christ, according to
the gospels, and translated as "hell", it is "Hades". Since "Hades," in
early greek translations, is simply a translation of the word "Sheol",
this is the first word that will be analyzed.</p>
<p>The hebrew word "Sheol" of the old testament was translated in the
Septuagint into greek as "hades" and this was later translated into
latin as "inferno" and also translated into germanic languages as “hel”
or “helle” and later translated into english as “hell” and from the
latin into spanish as "infierno".</p>
<p>The "Sheol" of the old testament, of the hebrew scriptures, has
certain characteristics that are deduced from the context in which the
word is used.</p>
<h5 id="everyone_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-115"></span>Everyone.</h5>
<p>From Genesis 37, it is understood that Jacob, Israel himself, went to
“Sheol” when he died <a href="#fn270" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref270"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>270</sup></a>. From Job 14, it follows that Job,
a righteous man according to the creator himself, would also go to
"Sheol" if he died in that moment <a href="#fn271" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref271" role="doc-noteref"><sup>271</sup></a>. From Job 21, the
wicked go down quietly to “Sheol” <a href="#fn272" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref272" role="doc-noteref"><sup>272</sup></a>. From Psalm 16, 18
and 86, David, the man according to heart of God, went to “Sheol” when
he died <a href="#fn273" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref273"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>273</sup></a>.</p>
<p>According to the old testament ALL the dead go to "Sheol", both those
we consider good, and those we consider bad. ALL the dead go to
“Sheol”.</p>
<h5 id="raise_DOT_"><span id="anchor-116"></span>Raise.</h5>
<p>From 1st Samuel 2, it is understood that YHWH is the one who takes
down to "Sheol" and also raises the dead from it <a href="#fn274"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref274"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>274</sup></a>. From Amos 9, no one can hide in
“Sheol” because YHWH takes them out, He raises them up, out of “Sheol”
<a href="#fn275" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref275"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>275</sup></a>. From Psalm 16, YHWH does not
leave his friend in “Sheol” <a href="#fn276" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref276" role="doc-noteref"><sup>276</sup></a>. Of the Psalm 30,
same, YHWH rises from “Sheol” <a href="#fn277" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref277" role="doc-noteref"><sup>277</sup></a>. From Hosea 13, YHWH
rescues from “Sheol” and death no longer has a sting <a href="#fn278"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref278"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>278</sup></a>.</p>
<p>According to the Tanakh, the Old Testament, the hebrew scriptures, of
the "Sheol" people can get out. They come out when YHWH takes them out
of “Sheol”. When YHWH raises the person from “Sheol”. Jesus Christ went
to Sheol when he died and left Sheol when he was resurrected.</p>
<h5 id="nothing_DOT_"><span id="anchor-117"></span>Nothing.</h5>
<p>From 1 Samuel 2, it is understood that there is no life in "Sheol",
it seems obvious but it seems some people forget it <a href="#fn279"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref279"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>279</sup></a>. From Job 14, in "Sheol" the wrath
of YHWH cannot be felt <a href="#fn280" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref280" role="doc-noteref"><sup>280</sup></a>. From Proverbs 15,
there are no thoughts in the “Sheol” <a href="#fn281"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref281"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>281</sup></a>. From Psalm 6, there are no
memories in “Sheol” <a href="#fn282" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref282"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>282</sup></a>. From Psalm 30, there is no life
in "Sheol", it seems obvious but some people seem to forget that <a
href="#fn283" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref283"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>283</sup></a>. From Ecclesiastes 9, in "Sheol"
nothing is done, nor one thinks, nor is there knowledge, nor wisdom <a
href="#fn284" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref284"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>284</sup></a>.</p>
<p>According to the Tanakh, the hebrew scriptures, in "Sheol" nothing
happens, you are dead, that’s it. Period.</p>
<h5 id="different_DOT_"><span id="anchor-118"></span>Different.</h5>
<p>Only by making an analysis of the old testament we see that there are
great differences between what the bible teaches about "Sheol" and the
popular concept of "Hell".</p>
<p>The current popular concept of "hell" has so many similarities with
the greek concept of the underworld dominated by the greek god "Hades",
that it is difficult to think that it is not the same concept.
Underworld that, by the time of the Septuagint translation, had already
adopted the name of the god "Hades" who governed it according to greek
mythology. This greek concept is obviously not hebrew. Not a concept
that Jesus Christ would use in a hebrew context. This concept ends up
passing to the Romans in the latin word “inferno” and from these to the
current popular concept of "hell".</p>
<p>The concepts were mixed because, at the time of the Septuagint
translation, the best greek translation for the hebrew word "Sheol" was
"Hades", and the Septuagint translation was the basis for the other
translations.</p>
<p>The word "Hades" is used consistently in the New Testament with the
concept of "Sheol" of the old testament, with one very famous exception
that will be analyzed later, and NOT with the greek concept for “Hades”
which of course is NOT hebrew, and would NOT be used by Jesus Christ to
teach about scripture. He was after all the most hebrew of all
hebrews.</p>
<p>Some of the verses of the new testament that ratify the concept of
"Sheol" of the old testament, have already been mentioned in this
presentation, and they are in the mouth of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In John 11 Jesus affirms that: <strong>“<strong>O</strong>ur friend,
Lazarus, has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awake him out
of sleep" <a href="#fn285" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref285"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>285</sup></a></strong> and then explains
<strong>“<strong>L</strong>azarus is dead" <a href="#fn286"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref286"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>286</sup></a></strong>. In Mark 5 and Luke 8
Yeshua affirms: <strong>“<strong>S</strong>he isn’t dead, but sleeping"
<a href="#fn287" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref287"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>287</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Matthew 27 also uses the same terminology <a href="#fn288"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref288"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>288</sup></a>. And Paul uses the same
terminology in 1 Corinthians 11 <a href="#fn289" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref289" role="doc-noteref"><sup>289</sup></a> and 1 Thessalonians
4 <a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>290</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In Acts 2, Jesus Christ comes out of the hebrew “Sheol” <a
href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>291</sup></a>. Peter quoted by Luke speaks to a
crowd and he quotes King David. The word in Acts is obviously "Hades"
but we know from the context that he is quoting from the old testament
the word "Sheol".</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that some people would like to put Jesus Christ
preaching the gospel in "Sheol" because of the verse in 1st Peter that
says he preached the gospel to the dead <a href="#fn292"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>292</sup></a>, but nowhere in the context
appears the word G86, the "Hadés". And obviously, "the dead”, in this
context, have the same sense that uses Jesus Christ himself when
referring to people who are physically ALIVE but DEAD spiritually,
because otherwise it would not be a hebrew concept, of the hebrew
scriptures. And Jesus Christ came to fulfill the prophecies, to confirm,
to fill them up, to complete, to give FULLNESS, to the HEBREW writings.
It is obvious that Jesus Christ preached the gospel to the dead because
they were all spiritually dead before Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The new testament ratifies the old. Jesus Christ was in the grave,
dead, doing nothing and now he is alive because he came out of the grave
upon resurrection. And, according to Jesus Christ, when someone is
resurrected, it is to not die again because you can no longer die.</p>
<p>The only thing the "Sheol" of the hebrew scriptures has in common
with the popular "hell" is that they both have dead people, but they are
not even the same dead people.</p>
<h4 id="ge-henna_DOT_-code-g1067_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-119"></span>Ge-Henna.

<p>The second and last of the two greek words used by Jesus Christ,
according to the gospels, and translated as "hell", it’s the
"Ge-Henna".</p>
<p>The Ge-Henna, that is, the valley of Hinnom described by Jesus Christ
in 11 verses from the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and named one
single time in the letter of James, the one that ended up being
translated as "hell", has a series of characteristics that are deduced
by the context in which the word is used.</p>
<h5 id="its-of-fire_DOT_"><span id="anchor-120"></span>It's of fire.</h5>
<p>From Matthew 5 <a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293"

is of fire. Jesus Christ speaks of a valley made of fire.</p>
<h5 id="it-does-not-turn-off_DOT_"><span id="anchor-121"></span>It does not

<p>From Mark 9 <a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>296</sup></a>, it is understood that the fire of
that valley does not go out. In this chapter it is made clear the
biblical reference to Isaiah 66 <a href="#fn297" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref297" role="doc-noteref"><sup>297</sup></a> because it uses the
same terminology. In hebrew it is the phrase “does not quench”.</p>
<h5 id="life_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-122"></span>Life.</h5>
<p>From Matthew 18 <a href="#fn298" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref298"

role="doc-noteref"><sup>299</sup></a>, it is understood that entering
the Life and being placed in this valley are two exclusive things. They
also show us that before being able to enter Life it was impossible to
be thrown into this valley. And let us remember that our Lord says
<strong>“I am the way, the truth and the life” <a href="#fn300"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref300"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>300</sup></a></strong>, He is the Life, before
Jesus Christ it was impossible to enter Life. Then before Jesus Christ,
it was impossible to put someone in this valley.</p>

the Kingdom of God and being placed in this valley are two exclusive
things. It also tells us that before entering God’s Kingdom it was
impossible to be thrown into this valley. When Jesus Christ sends out 70
of his disciples, in Luke 10, he says
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>H</strong>eal the sick who are there,
and tell them, ‘God’s Kingdom has come near to you’<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn302" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref302"

Before Jesus Christ the Kingdom of God had not arrived, then before
Jesus Christ it was impossible to put someone in this Valley.</p>

that valley is eternal. Here the word is G166 <a href="#fn307"

<h5 id="the-worm-does-not-die_DOT_"><span id="anchor-129"></span>The worm
does not die.</h5>
<p>From Mark 9 <a href="#fn314" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref314"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>314</sup></a>, it is understood that in that
valley the worm does not die. In this chapter it is made clear the
biblical reference to Isaiah 66 <a href="#fn315" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref315" role="doc-noteref"><sup>315</sup></a> because it uses the
same terminology. The worm of Isaiah 66 is the word H8438 <a
href="#fn316" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref316"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>316</sup></a> that refers to the “coccus-ilicis”
that was used both for medicinal purposes and to prepare a scarlet dye.
This word appears in almost all the cloth parts of the tabernacle of
Moses and in the clothing of the priests of the tabernacle <a
href="#fn317" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref317"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>317</sup></a>. It is also the word used in psalm
22 <a href="#fn318" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref318"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>318</sup></a> quoted by our Lord on the cross.
And it is the same with which, in Isaiah 41, God calls "worm" to Jacob
<a href="#fn319" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref319"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>319</sup></a>. Tabernacle, priest clothes, Jesus
Christ, Jacob. All the same “worm” from Isaiah 66.</p>
<p>Paul in 2nd Corinthians 5 <a href="#fn320" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref320" role="doc-noteref"><sup>320</sup></a> compares our body to
a tent, with a tabernacle, because just as the presence of God was in
the tabernacle of Moses, the Holy Spirit lives in the body of the
believers. He also compares it to a dress that is clothed with the
purity of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>These observations allow us to conclude that the "worm does not die"
refers to the BODY of the person who is in that valley. The valley is
NOT the cause of death of the person's body, of physical death.</p>
<h5 id="destroyer_DOT_"><span id="anchor-130"></span>Destroyer.</h5>
<p>From Matthew 10 <a href="#fn321" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref321"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>321</sup></a>, it is understood that there is a
person who can use that valley to destroy body and spirit. The word for
destroy is the G622 <a href="#fn322" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref322"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>322</sup></a> which is not only used in the
sense of “killing” but also in the sense of being ruined, or lost. For
example it is used in Matthew 15 when our Lord says that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> wasn’t sent to anyone but
the lost sheep of the house of Israel<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn323" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref323"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>323</sup></a></strong></strong>. Here obviously
these little sheep have not been killed but they are "destroyed",
“ruined”, “degraded”, “lost” in perdition. That valley destroys, ruins,
ends, degrades body and spirit but NOT to an irreversible state because
“the worm does not die”.</p>
<h5 id="different_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-131"></span>Different.</h5>
<p>Taking all the characteristics of the Valley of Hinnom, the most
important difference with the popular hell is that the valley of Hinnom
only acts over those who are PHYSICALLY ALIVE. Either before or after
the physical resurrection but only acts on LIVING people who have a
physical body. Not that any son of Adam can have any kind of life
without a physical body, but since some people think so, that the dead
are still alive, well, the emphasis must be made: PHYSICALLY ALIVE in
BODY and SPIRIT.</p>
<p>It obviously has several features similar to those of the popular
“hell”: it is made of fire, the fire does not go out, it is eternal, it
executes a judgment, it also acts after the resurrection and it is
destructive. But it only acts on physical beings and the destructive
effect is reversible.</p>
<p>This concept of the Valley of Hinnom that we see reflected in these
features also has other differences from the popular “hell”: it acts
from before physical death, it only exists since Jesus Christ began to
preach the Kingdom of God, and the fire that forms it, salts, sprinkles
over, ALL people physically alive but spiritually dead.</p>
<p>It is similar but different. This is a spiritual concept with
physical effects, just like sin, which is also an spiritual concept with
physical effects.</p>
<p>This concept is perfectly consistent with what was observed when we
spoke of divine justice: with the intentions that Yeshua claims to have
in Luke 12 when he states that: <strong>“<strong>I</strong> came to
throw <strong>FIRE</strong> on the earth. I wish it were already
kindled" <a href="#fn324" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref324"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>324</sup></a></strong>. As said, the pyromaniac
is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>John the Baptist, according to Matthew 3, explains to us about Jesus
Christ that: <strong><strong>“He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.
His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his
threshing floor. He will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff
he will burn up with unquenchable fire” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn325" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref325"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>325</sup></a></strong></strong>. Jehovah, in
Malachi 3, warns us: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong>ho can
endure the day of his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he
is like a refiner’s fire, and like launderers’ soap<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn326" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref326"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>326</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>This fire divides those who are initially saved from those who are
initially condemned. Paul explains it in 2nd Corinthians 2 as follows:
<strong>“But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal
procession in Christ and who makes known through us the fragrance that
consists of the knowledge of him in every place. For we are a sweet
aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those
who are perishing, to the latter an odor from death to death, but to the
former a fragrance from life to life. And who is adequate for these
things? For we are not like so many others, hucksters who peddle the
word of God for profit, but we are speaking in Christ before God as
persons of sincerity, as persons sent from God” <a href="#fn327"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref327"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>327</sup></a></strong>. In this case the fire is
compared to a fragrance, for some mortal, for others fragrance of
life.</p>
<p>It is a fire that ends the bad guys, it ends some before physical
death and others after the physical resurrection, because
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>m</strong>any will be last who are
first, and first who are last<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn328"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref328"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>328</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>God's love is a consuming fire, his Spirit is a fire of Life, that
consumes death, a fire of Truth, that puts an end to lies, a Holy fire,
which ends sin. If I resist that fire, if I am attached to my spiritual
death, to my lie, to my sin, it is going to destroy me, it will ruin me,
degrade me. If I join that fire, I become part of it and I will have
Life, Truth and Holiness. Or as Jesus Christ says in Matthew 16:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong>or whoever desires to save
his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will
find it<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn329" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref329"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>329</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Once this fire is done with each one of us, the only thing that will
we see of the sinner, of the one who rebelled against God, of the dead
spirit that was sprinkled with this fire of Life when he heard the good
news of the resurrection, the only thing we will see will be the body of
that person, of the dead one, and the memories of that person.</p>
<p>Once that fire does the hot update, without halting, while running,
of the operating system, of the person, the only thing that will remain
of the old person, from the old operating system, will be his memories
and the body it inhabited.</p>
<p>That fire will be that new operating system, that new holy person,
that Holy Spirit, in the image and likeness of Yeshua HaMashiakh, of our
savior Jesus Christ. A fire that will never stop burning. And if the
update does not end before physical death, it just continues after the
physical resurrection. And if the update had not started before physical
death, it will start after resurrection.</p>
<p>Once the update is finished, the only thing we will be able to do is
to look at that body, remember what that person did, shake your head and
think "how wretched". Or as Isaiah 66 puts it:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong>nd they shall go forth, and
look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for
their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they
shall be an abhorring unto <strong>ALL</strong>
<strong>FLESH</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn330"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref330"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>330</sup></a></strong></strong>. To ALL FLESH,
including mine, and yours, already resurrected.</p>
<p>Neither the popular hell, nor the popular heaven, exist in the
scriptures, in the bible thought in hebrew. But we can say that the
valley of Hinnom is: a hell for the bad guys and a heaven for the good
guys ; a hell for the one who is lost and a heaven for the one who is
saved ; a hell for the one who denies Jesus Christ and a heaven for the
one who accepts him. And NO son of Adam starts out being good, saved,
holy or saint.</p>
<p>Either I am fire or I burn. And no child of Adam starts out being
fire.</p>
<h4 id="eternal-death_DOT_"><span id="anchor-132"></span>Eternal death.</h4>
<p>There is not a single verse in the bible, neither in hebrew nor in
greek that has the phrase "eternal death". Nothing, zip, zero, none,
NADA. It does not exist a single verse that has the sequence in greek of
the words G2288, thanatos, death, followed by G166, aiónios, eternal.
Nor is there any verse that has the sequence H4194 H5769 or H4193 H5769,
the possible sequences for "eternal death" in hebrew. None, nothing,
zero. Not one single verse.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on ETERNAL LIFE. 37 verses in the New Testament have
the phrase in greek "ETERNAL LIFE", that is to say the word G2222, zoe,
followed by the word G166, aiónios, and more than 50 verses refer to
that life, to LIFE in Christ Jesus, to eternal life, whether before or
after the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>Even so, the only verse in which the phrase "eternal punishment"
appears, in some translations of Matthew 25, it is arguable that it
means a punishment in the normal sense of the word, but a correction. A
firely one.</p>
<p>In the greek the word translated as "punishment" or "torment" is the
word G2851 kolasis. Kolasis means correction according to the Mr
Strong’s code. In addition, it comes from the word G2849 kolazó, which
some scholars argue that it was used for the word “prune”, as when a
tree is pruned. Which reminds me of the burning bush that never consumes
that Moses saw. That is to say, the phrase, arguably, should be
translated as "eternal correction”. A firely one.</p>
<p>In any case, the sequence G2851 followed by G166 only appears in one
verse. ONE single verse in the entire New Testament. A single verse for
the greek phrase that some translate as "punishment eternal".</p>
<p>The other word used to denote God's punishment is the word G3709,
orgé, which translates “wrath”. This word followed by the word for
eternity, the G166, does not appear even once in the entire New
Testament. An "eternal wrath" in the greek New Testament does not
appear, not once, nothing, ZERO. On the contrary, in several parts the
bible tells us that the wrath of God lasts only an instant, a moment,
and that God is very slow to anger. And in various parts of the bible
tells us that God's mercy and love is ETERNAL.</p>
<p>The emphasis in the New Testament is on ETERNAL LIFE and ETERNAL
LOVE.</p>
<h4 id="eternal-punishment_DOT_"><span id="anchor-133"></span>Eternal
punishment.</h4>
<p>Psalm 37 says that the wicked will be cut down, that they wither,
that they will be cut off, that they will not be, that you will
diligently consider their place and it shall not, that their day is
coming, that their sword will enter their own hearts, that they will
perish, that they <span id="anchor-134"></span>consume away like smoke,
that they will pass away, that you sought them and did not find them,
that they will be destroyed <a href="#fn331" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref331" role="doc-noteref"><sup>331</sup></a>. And Psalm 14 says
that: <strong><strong>“Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of
men, to see if there were any who understood, who sought after God. They
have all gone aside. They have together </strong><strong>become corrupt.
There is no one who does good, no, not one” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn332" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref332"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>332</sup></a></strong></strong>. The mechanism
by which God makes all things new is by means of an eternal fire, the
fire of his Holy Spirit. Good defeats evil, love defeats hate.</p>
<p>Although the biblical punishment for those who do evil, for the
wicked, is death, the bible does NOT speak of an "eternal death" or a
"eternal punishment” for the wicked one. "Eternal death" is NOT the
phrase used by the bible to refer to what happens to the wicked because
Jesus Christ came, died and rose again just to get us out of death, both
the spiritual and the physical death. There is death and there is
punishment, it’s only that they are not eternal.</p>
<p>But LET'S ASSUME, LET'S ACCEPT, LET'S BELIEVE, that YES, that when
the bible says that the bad ones wither, that they will be destroyed,
that they will be searched for and not found, that their day is coming,
that their sword will enter their own heart, that they will perish, that
they dissipate like the smoke, that they will be eliminated, that they
will be exterminated, that they will disappear, that they will be
destroyed, it refers to the fact that they die eternally and that is
their eternal punishment.</p>
<p>Let us see how one can understand an eternal destruction, a quote and
quote, “eternal death”, a quote and quote, “eternal punishment”, in the
context of what the living God really promises: an ETERNAL LIFE.</p>
<p>The destruction, the disappearance of the wicked, of the one who is
already dead spiritually, of that which is dying physically, that
definitive, total and ETERNAL destruction, begins when he is born again,
when that evil, that spiritually dead person, is made a new creature by
our Celestial Father, and the spiritually dead person begins his ETERNAL
destruction. It is no longer the wicked who lives, but Christ that lives
in him, the spiritually dead person, because his eternal destruction has
already began, thus suffering his, quote and quote, "eternal
PUNISHMENT". Now Jesus Christ lives in him and began the ETERNAL life of
the NEW CREATURE. The Christ that lives in that new creature begins to
live the eternal Life in the eternal fire of the Holy Spirit that
destroys, ends, disappears, vanishes the sting of death in the wicked,
and ALL the wickedness that was in the spiritually dead person starts
its ETERNAL destruction, leading to his, quote and quote, "eternal
PUNISHMENT".</p>
<p>At the moment of being born again, the old self, the evil one, begins
its final journey to eternal destruction, and the new me, the new
creature, begins his final journey to an eternal life. That trip is
through the eternal fire, and the old me, the evil one, will not like
it, but the new me, the good one, will like it more and more. In the
end, that wicked man will stop existing because he suffers his eternal
punishment, he is eternally destroyed, and the whole person, the entire
NEW CREATURE is transformed into, the Good, the Holy, the Worthy, the
Deserving, Jesus Christ Himself, in that body of the old me.</p>
<p>The transformation is a process where not everything is burned and
not everything is transformed. The new creature is born in the old
creature and grows until completely transformed into the new
creature.</p>
<p>In some believers in Yeshua, the part that will be transformed is
precisely the one who believes that for the Creator of heaven and earth,
that changed his heart of stone for one of flesh, so that it wanted to
repent of his sins, and seek, and choose, and accept Jesus Christ, and
thus be able to love his Creator above all things, that for THE Creator,
who also created all other people, that for said creator it is too hard,
or will be too hard, to transform the hearts of others who have ALSO
refused to accept Him, or choose Him, or seek Him at some other given
time. That part of that kind of believer will suffer the eternal
punishment of the fire of the valley of Hinnom that will destroy it
forever. That part will suffer, quote and quote, “an eternal death,"
when the believer, either before or after his physical resurrection,
realizes that what he believed was FALSE.</p>
<p>The evil one that we have inside, that enemy of God that we have
inside, is being transformed into a new creature, listen “NEW”, by the
spirit of the living God who now lives in every believer, that can
believe that ALL of us will be transformed, because he is going to see
it with his own eyes: we are going to see each other again and embrace
each other as brothers in Jesus Christ. That is the biblical promise of
the God who does not lie.</p>
<h4 id="lake-of-fire_DOT_"><span id="anchor-135"></span>Lake of fire.</h4>
<p>The lake of fire, mentioned in the last chapters of the book of
Revelation, is a third option that is commonly related to the popular
"hell". Interestingly this lake has NEVER been translated as hell.
Neither in the first translations nor in the modern ones. The reason is
that the hebrew word "Sheol" is the true origin of the appearances of
the word “Hades” in the greek translations of the hebrew scriptures, now
known as the Old Testament, for its appearance in the Septuagint since
before Jesus Christ. And when the new testament was written in greek,
this word, the "Hadés", never was the “limné-tou-pyros”, that is, the
lake of fire. The Hades was the “Hadés” and the “limné-tou-pyros” was
the “limné-tou-pyros”. There was never an opportunity for them to get
mixed.</p>
<p>So why did the lake of fire also end up being a popular "hell"?</p>
<p>According to the book of Revelation, to the lake of fire are thrown
the false prophet, the beast or monster, the Satan or dragon or devil or
ancient serpent, also death is thrown to it, and Hades is thrown to it,
that one that comes from "Sheol", or grave. And are also thrown
partially, or as the bible says "shall have their part", the cowardly,
unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral,
sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars.</p>
<p>Kind of, but not.</p>
<p>The bible narrates that "Sheol" and death will be thrown into this
lake. This fact tells us that it is a spiritual concept, not a physical
one.</p>
<p>This lake of fire is the "eternal punishment", quote and quote, for
the evil, death itself and the grave. It is the end of the grave. It is
the end of death, that is to say that there is no more death, neither
spiritual nor physical.</p>
<p>The lake of fire is the second death for those who were still
spiritually dead, those who had died physically but the eternal
destruction of their wickedness has not ended. Even if the process had
already started.</p>
<p>The only ones who are not affected by this second death are the first
resurrected, those who were already fully alive physically and
spiritually. Those who had already suffered the eternal destruction of
their wickedness and that is why they were the first fruits, the first
to be resurrected. This second death does not affect them because they
are already fully alive both physically and spiritually. And let's
remember that you are resurrected so as to not die again because you can
no longer die.</p>
<p>The first resurrected are a few. 144 thousand saints, men, all
Israelites, genetic descendants of Abraham, who reigned with Christ for
a thousand years, from Jerusalem in the temple described in the book of
Ezekiel. Temple to be built at the beginning of the thousand years, when
our Lord returns. They are a FEW because many are called but few are
chosen of Abraham's genetic descendants. A few who will not have
relations with women during those thousand years, because they are
already resurrected and the women who live during those thousand years
have not yet been risen. It is a forbidden mating between two different
kind of bodies.</p>
<p>The rest, you and I, who are not genetic descendants of Abraham,
after the thousand years and after the resurrection of the dead: to the
lake o fire, sooner or later, at least in part. As believer, follower,
and disciple of Yeshua, that you believe you are, however written in the
book of life that you think you are, you HAVE SIN my brother, you have
at least a little lie, and that part of yours goes to the lake of fire
in chapter 21, that is if you were not sent completely in chapter 20 of
the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>Only until the end will all things be known and that is what the lake
of fire is for: to purify all those little lies, purifying them as
silver is purified: with FIRE. And fire BURNS. It's exactly the same
fire of Ge-Henna, of Ge Hinom, of the valley of Hinnom. Either you are
fire or you burn. And no one starts out being fire.</p>
<p>After the resurrection of ALL the dead, when we meet with all those
who hurt us and with all those who we hurt, we will have to admit what
we did. At that time it will be impossible to deny the Truth, to deny
Jesus Christ, to deny reality. And as they say: "The Truth hurts", or in
this case BURNS.</p>
<p>It is the absolute reconciliation due to the impossibility of denying
our lie, our spiritual death, our sin. And that little fire BURNS, ends
evil. It kills the evil one, that spiritually dead that we are, you and
I, without the FIRE of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h4 id="excluded_DOT_"><span id="anchor-136"></span>Excluded.</h4>
<p>According to the 3 most popular english translations of the bible, in
2nd Thessalonians 1, the wicked shall be punished with eternal
destruction, and <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>SHUT</strong>
<strong>OUT</strong> from the presence <strong>of the
Lord</strong><strong>”</strong></strong>, according to the New
International Version, and
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>AWAY</strong><strong> from the
presence of the Lord”</strong></strong>, according to the English
Standard Version, and <strong><strong>“forever
</strong><strong>SEPARATED </strong><strong>from the
Lord”</strong></strong>, according to the New Living Translation, all
meaning EXCLUDED from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his
power <a href="#fn333" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref333"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>333</sup></a>, but according to the first
translations, the Geneva, the Coverdale, and the King James,
translations, the bad guys will be punished with eternal destruction
“from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power” <a
href="#fn334" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref334"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>334</sup></a>. That is to say that now days they
are “excluded” of the presence of the Lord, but before, in the first
translations, said destruction came FROM the presence of the Lord,
meaning they were IN the presence of the Lord. Completely the
opposite.</p>
<p>Which one do we believe? It is in these cases when you have to
resort, as close as possible, to the originals <a href="#fn335"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref335"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>335</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This is the only case, the only verse in the entire bible, in which
the word G575, the word “apo”, which literally means “from”,
mysteriously in the popular translations of 2nd Thessalonians 1, appear
accompanied by words that are not in the original greek. Words like
“shut out”, or “separated”, or “away”, or "far away". In the original
text there is no word that correspond to anything like that.</p>
<p>In the more than 650 occurrences, LISTEN WELL more than 650
occurrences, in the greek of the word G575, the word that means “from”,
there is NOT another occurrence that the same thing happens to it: that
without any modifying word that accompanies it gets translated as “shut
out from”, or “away from”, or “separated from". So, according even to
biblehub, this would be the ONLY verse in the ENTIRE bible in which the
second meaning of the word, “away from”, according to biblehub I repeat,
could be applied. Could instead be that said meaning NEVER applies? And
that biblehub includes it only to match the prejudices of its editors
with respect to this ONLY verse in more that 650 others?</p>
<p>For example in Acts 19 when talking about Paul it says that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>w</strong>hen divers were hardened,
and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he
departed from them, and separated the
disciple<strong>s</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn336"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref336"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>336</sup></a></strong></strong>, Paul "departs
from" them, and in the greek the word G868 appears, which means
precisely that "to lead away”, “to depart from”, it appears to modify
the "from" and indicate this “departing”.</p>
<p>The same happens with every other occurrence of the word G575. When
translated "beware of" is the word G4337 modifying the G575, when
translated "far from" is the word G3112 modifying it, when translated
"delivered from" is the word G4506. And so with all the other
occurrences.</p>
<p>In 2nd Thessalonians 1 when translated “away from” <a href="#fn337"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref337" role="doc-noteref"><sup>337</sup></a>
the only modifier word is the word G3639, which means “ruin”, or
"destruction". That is to say that the literal translation would be:
“destruction eternal from the presence of the Lord”. It is the presence
of the Lord that destroys forever. However, in some translations,
additional words appear mysteriously, like “shut out”, which would be
the word G1576, or a combination of the word G1544 with the G1854. But
these words do not appear anywhere in the original greek of the verse in
question of 2nd Thessalonians 1. It is the ONLY case in the more than
650 occurrences that something like this happens.</p>
<p>This situation is a sign that: no matter how well-intentioned a
translation, the preconceptions, the prejudices, of the translator are
reflected in the translation.</p>
<p>And thanks to the fact that YHWH is pouring out His Spirit on all
peoples and nations using the Internet, now anyone can interpret
correctly the first tongue that must be interpreted correctly: the
tongue in which our Lord Jesus Christ thought, spoke and prayed, his
followers and ALL the authors of what is now known as the New Testament
when they wrote it: the same tongue as the Old Testament. The second
tongue to learn to interpret correctly is the tongue in which it was
finally written. Both are relatively easy to interpret using the
Internet and some other open source programs. Both necessary for the
Holy Spirit to enable us to understand, discern, interpret, what Paul
explains not only in this very important case, but also with respect to
other cases that are also very important. Such as the case of "speaking
in tongues". This way we avoid ending up “spinning in longas” or
"trampling the tongues", as some do, and believing that what they do
it's biblical. The problem is not so much in what they do, but in
believing that it is biblical.</p>
<p>Thus, between these translations of the bible, the translation that
best reflects the meaning of the verse in greek is that of the older
versions: the wicked will be punished with eternal perdition
<strong>“<strong>FROM</strong> the presence of the Lord, and
<strong>FROM</strong> the glory of his power” <a href="#fn338"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref338"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>338</sup></a></strong>. They will be punished
“IN” the presence, “IN” the glory of God. That punishment comes “FROM”
his presence, “FROM” his glory.</p>
<p>This is completely the OPPOSITE of the sense in popular translations
in most languages. It is precisely IN the presence and IN his glory the
punishment is given.</p>
<p>God shows up and his presence destroys evil. Overcome evil with
kindness as Paul says. In the presence of the FIRE of the Holy Spirit
the evil of a person is destroyed and this becomes a Ge-Henna of FIRE
for that evil, it becomes a lake of FIRE for the evil that dwells in the
physical body of that person. And fire BURNS. Before or after the
physical resurrection of the person, but it BURNS.</p>
<p>Either I am fire or I burn. And no child of Adam starts out being
fire.</p>
<h4 id="the-rich-and-the-poor-lazarus_DOT_"><span id="anchor-137"></span>The
rich and the poor Lazarus.</h4>
<p>The famous PARABLE of Jesus Christ known as "The rich and the poor
Lazarus,” found in Luke 16, is popularly cited as a example of what the
popular hell and popular eternal punishment is literally like <a
href="#fn339" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref339"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>339</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Some observations for those who have read it or are interested in
reading it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The parable is addressed to some pharisees, that judging from what
Jesus Christ tells them it seems that they liked to repudiate their
wives and marry multiple times.</li>
<li>The authority in the parable is not YHWH, the Heavenly Father, but
Abraham. Who those pharisees were proud to be descendants of.</li>
<li>The parable ends by saying: But Abraham
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>s</strong>aid to him, ‘If they don’t
listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if one
rises from the dead<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn340"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref340"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>340</sup></a></strong></strong>.</li>
<li>The parable cannot refer to a time after the resurrection of the
dead because the rich man's brothers have not died physically. And
therefore much less to a time after to the final judgment that follows
the resurrection of the dead.</li>
</ol>
<p>That means that the whole parable is just a parallel in which the
rich man represents the pharisees, the poor Lazarus the pagans, and the
rich man's brothers are the Jewish followers of the pharisees. It is an
announcement of Jesus Christ to the pharisees of what was going to
happen to them: that they would not believe in the one who is going to
rise from the dead, which is Jesus Christ himself, the one who speaks,
and that this will lead to an abysmal separation with those who did
believe in him, most of them pagans, who were despised by those
pharisees, those spiritually poor, because they did not have the Law of
Moses, represented by Lazarus.</p>
<p>A separation like the one experienced by the Jews and the pharisees,
who did not believe in their Meshiakh, with respect to the pagans, who
did believe in Jesus Christ. The pagan ends up being an Israelite in the
bosom of Abraham, just as Paul explains in Romans 11, and the pharisee
ends up expelled from God's people living a spiritual equivalent to the
greek "hades" for almost 2000 years.</p>
<p>This is the only passage in the bible where the word G86, hades, is
not used in the hebrew sense of "Sheol." The reason is that this parable
is an adaptation that Jesus Christ does of a popular greek tale, which
itself is an adaptation of a popular egyptian tale, in order to make a
prophecy to some rebellious hebrews. Prophecy that has been fulfilled in
the past 2000 years or so.</p>
<h4 id="free-will_DOT_"><span id="anchor-138"></span>Free will.</h4>
<p>From a strictly logical, strictly rational point of view, it is
impossible to distinguish good from bad without knowing The Truth. If I
do not know the truth, if I don't have access to the truth, how can I
distinguish good from evil? Impossible.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ identifies himself as The Truth. He says in John 14
<strong>“<strong>I</strong> am the way, the truth, and the life” <a
href="#fn341" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref341"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>341</sup></a></strong>. Then without The Truth,
without Jesus Christ, it is impossible to distinguish between good and
bad. That is why Jesus Christ tells us, according to John 8, that:
<strong>“If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples. You
will know the truth, and the truth will make you free” <a href="#fn342"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref342"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>342</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>If we do not know Jesus Christ, if we do not know The Truth, we are
not Truly free. It is possible to choose, to decide, but it is not
possible to choose correctly. You are not TRULY free.</p>
<p>Paul further explains in Romans 9 <a href="#fn343"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref343"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>343</sup></a>: <strong>“Not only so, but Rebekah
also conceived by one, by our father Isaac. For being not yet born,
neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God
according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,
it was said to her, 'The elder will serve the younger'. Even as it is
written, 'Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated'.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God?
May it never be! For he said to Moses, 'I will have mercy on whom I have
mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion'. So then it
is NOT of him who WILLS, <strong>NOR</strong> of him who RUNS, but of
GOD who has mercy. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, 'For this very
<strong>PURPOSE</strong> I caused you to be raised up, that I might show
in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in ALL the earth'.
So then, he has mercy on whom he DESIRES, and he hardens whom he
DESIRES.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You will say then to me, 'Why does he still find fault? For
who WITHSTANDS his will?' But indeed, O man, who are you to reply
against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, 'Why did you
make me like this?'. Or hasn’t the <strong>POTTER</strong> a right over
the <strong>CLAY</strong>, from the same lump to make one part a vessel
for honor, and another for dishonor?”,</strong></p>
<p>In other words, the thing depends is on God, not on me. It’s not that
I choose God but that he chooses me, and thanks to that, later, I can
choose him.</p>
<p>In Exodus we see that it is YHWH who hardens Pharaoh's heart. Since
Exodus 4, when Moses hadn't even gotten to Egypt to see Pharaoh, just
after it seemed that God was making Moses a little stubborn, YHWH says
to Moses: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>W</strong>hen you go back
into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have
put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the
people go<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn344"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref344"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>344</sup></a></strong></strong>. Then the bible
repeats us 8 times, almost one by plague, that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong><strong> will harden
Pharaoh's heart” </strong><strong><a href="#fn345" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref345" role="doc-noteref"><sup>345</sup></a></strong></strong>
and that <strong><strong>”</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>he
</strong><strong>Lord</strong><strong> hardened Pharaoh's heart”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn346" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref346"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>346</sup></a></strong></strong>, so that the
idea becomes clear. It is YHWH who hardens Pharaoh's heart.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah 24, Jehovah promises that: <strong>“I will
<strong>GIVE</strong> them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and
they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return
unto me with their whole heart” <a href="#fn347" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref347" role="doc-noteref"><sup>347</sup></a></strong>. In
Jeremiah 32, Jehovah promises that: <strong>“I will
<strong>GIVE</strong> them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me
for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: And I
will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away
from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that
they shall not depart from me” <a href="#fn348" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref348" role="doc-noteref"><sup>348</sup></a></strong>. In Ezekiel
36, YHWH promises that: <strong>“A <strong>NEW</strong> heart also will
I give you, and a <strong>NEW</strong> spirit will I put within you: and
I <strong>will</strong> <strong>TAKE</strong> <strong>AWAY</strong> the
stony heart out of your flesh, and I will <strong>GIVE</strong> you an
heart of flesh. And I <strong>will put</strong> my spirit within you,
and <strong>CAUSE</strong> you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep
my judgments, and do them” <a href="#fn349" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref349" role="doc-noteref"><sup>349</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>It is Yahweh who changes the heart. He puts his spirit within us and
He causes us to obey his laws.</p>
<p>You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who has
resisted His will?” And God himself answers us in Isaiah: <strong>"You
turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay;
that the thing made should say about him who made it, 'He didn’t make
me;' or the thing formed say of him who formed it, 'He has no
understanding?'” <a href="#fn350" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref350"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>350</sup></a></strong>. <strong>“Woe to him who
strives with his Maker, a clay <strong>POT</strong> among the clay
<strong>POTS</strong> of the earth! Shall the clay ask him who fashions
it, ‘What are you making?’ or your work, ‘He has no hands?’” <a
href="#fn351" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref351"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>351</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>He is the one making us, He knows what He is doing and He does it in
accordance to HIS will. Meaning as He pleases, period. Shut up. Thank
Him.</p>
<p>Paul explains in Romans 8 that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong>or the creation was
subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who
subjected it, in hope <strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn352"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref352"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>352</sup></a></strong></strong>. It is because
of the potter. Then he also explains, in Romans 11, that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>or God has bound
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> to disobedience, that he might
have mercy on </strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn353" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref353"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>353</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Jesus Christ came to set the captives free. Paul
explains in Ephesians 2 that: <strong><strong>“</strong>thanks be to
God, that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient
from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were delivered.
<strong>B</strong>eing made free from sin, you became bondservants of
righteousness<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn354"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref354"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>354</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>A slave to sin is not free. We were slaves to sin. The born again is
born into a slavery of Jesus Christ, into Jesus Christ’s gentle yoke, he
becomes a slave by his own free will, after God changed his heart so
that he could do it, he becomes a slave of The Truth and that makes him
free, TRULY FREE.</p>
<p>Some Jews, according to John 8, tell Jesus Christ that:
<strong><strong>"We are Abraham’s offspring, and have never been in
bondage to anyone. How do you say, ‘You will be made free?' Jesus
answered them, most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is
the bondservant of sin” </strong><strong><a href="#fn355"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref355"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>355</sup></a></strong></strong> So,
<strong><strong>“i</strong>f therefore the Son makes you free, you will
be free <strong>INDEED</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn356" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref356"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>356</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Without Jesus Christ that "free will" is not so "free". We cannot
even choose Him without the intervention of the Father, that is why the
same Yeshua, according to John 6, assures that
<strong>”<strong>N</strong>o one can come to me unless the Father who
sent me” <a href="#fn357" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref357"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>357</sup></a> “drag<strong>s</strong>
<strong>him </strong>first” <a href="#fn358" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref358" role="doc-noteref"><sup>358</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Father drags us first, changes our hearts, and THEN we
can choose Jesus Christ. Jehovah himself announces it to us from the
beginning: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>Y</strong>ahweh your God
will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your offspring, to love
Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may
live<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn359" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref359" role="doc-noteref"><sup>359</sup></a></strong></strong>.
He circumcises out heart, thanks to that, we can repent, return to God,
choose Jesus Christ, receive him, who is Life itself, and live
eternally, as one, with the living God.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ tells us, according to John 8, that:
<strong><strong>”Y</strong>ou will know the truth, and the truth will
make you free” <a href="#fn360" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref360"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>360</sup></a></strong>. He is the truth. Thus,
freedom, TRUE freedom, is proportional to that knowledge of The Truth,
of Jesus Christ. The more we know Jesus Christ the more truly free we
are. More TRUE will be that “free will”. And no one is born knowing
Jesus Christ, you have to be born again to begin knowing him. Then is
when a True Life begins, the eternal Life in Jesus Christ.</p>
<h4 id="bible_DOT_"><span id="anchor-139"></span>Bible.</h4>
<p>A majority of Christians, those who believe that <strong>"Christ died
for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he
was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures” <a
href="#fn361" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref361"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>361</sup></a></strong>, ACCORDING TO THE
SCRIPTURES, they also believe that there is physical torment, conscious
and eternal for a part of humanity.</p>
<p>Everything in the believer's life must be ACCORDING TO THE
SCRIPTURES. So Let's see what the scriptures teach of an absolute
reconciliation.</p>
<h5 id="adam_DOT_"><span id="anchor-140"></span>Adam.</h5>
<p>This creation was finished in 6 days because on the 7th day God
rested. Genesis 1 says that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>G</strong>od saw everything that he
had made, and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was
morning, a sixth day<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn362"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref362"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>362</sup></a></strong></strong>. And Paul
explains in Colossians 1 that by Christ
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> things were
created in the heavens and on the earth, visible things and invisible
things, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers.
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> things have been created through
him and for him. </strong><strong>H</strong><strong>e is before
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> things, and in him
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> things are held together”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn363" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref363"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>363</sup></a></strong></strong>. This obviously
includes Adam and his offspring. He adds that: <strong><strong>“For all
the fullness was pleased to dwell in him, and through him to reconcile
</strong><strong>ALL </strong><strong>things to himself by him, whether
things on the earth or things in the heavens, having made peace through
the blood of his cross” </strong><strong><a href="#fn364"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref364"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>364</sup></a></strong></strong>. Jesus Christ
reconciles ALL things to himself, not just part, not just a small
percentage, not just a few chosen. PLEASED the Father through Jesus
Christ to reconcile ALL things. The solution is much bigger than the
problem. Paul explains it in Romans 5
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>ut the free gift
isn’t like the trespass. For if by the trespass of the one
</strong><strong>(ADAM) </strong><strong>the many died,
</strong><strong>MUCH</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>MORE</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>did</strong><strong> the grace of God, and the gift by
the grace of the one man, </strong><strong>JESUS</strong><strong>
Christ, </strong><strong>ABOUND</strong><strong> to the many”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn365" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref365"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>365</sup></a></strong></strong>. Jesus Christ,
the solution, is much bigger than the problem: Adam. Why did grace
abound so much more? Well, because the raw material of Jesus Christ are
a handful of sinners and lost ones in perdition that He transforms into
Saints and Righteous through His Holy Spirit, while Adam was only one
and He was very well made, according to the Creator himself, and who
sinned because the Ancient Serpent, the Satan, deceived his companion
Eve. They took him on his sweet spot. The solution is much bigger than
the problem. And if the problem made EVERYONE fall, the solution also
promises to transform EVERYONE. 1st Corinthians 15:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong><strong>or as in Adam
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> die, so also in Christ
</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> will be made alive”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn366" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref366"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>366</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<h5 id="abraham_DOT_"><span id="anchor-141"></span>Abraham.</h5>
<p>The promise that YHWH makes to Abram in Genesis 12 is that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> will bless those who bless
you, and I will curse him who treats you with contempt.
<strong>ALL</strong> the families of the earth will be blessed through
you<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn367" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref367" role="doc-noteref"><sup>367</sup></a></strong></strong>.
This was when Abram was 75 years old and still had no children. Later,
God promises him a son and as time passes and nothing happens, Abram
decides to help God and has Ishmael with his wife's slave. And Jehovah,
in Genesis 18, just before destroying Sodom with fire falling from the
heavens, confirms his plan:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong> the nations on
the earth may receive blessing through him” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn368" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref368"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>368</sup></a></strong></strong>. But Isaac
wasn't born yet. And it also seems that Sodom and Gomorrah was not part
of that "ALL" nations and “ALL” families of the earth. In Genesis 22,
God confirms the promise to Abraham when Isaac was already young and
Abraham had almost killed him by order of Jehovah. Clarifying that it is
in his seed that <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>ALL</strong><strong>
the nations of the earth will be blessed by your offspring”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn369" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref369"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>369</sup></a></strong></strong>. Years later,
when Isaac was already married, God repeats the promise to Isaac in
Genesis 26 <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>n your
offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn370" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref370"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>370</sup></a></strong></strong>. And to Jacob,
who would later be called Israel, being young and still single, but
having stolen his older brother’s blessing, read it “inheritance”,
Jehovah also speaks to him and tells him
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>n you and in your
offspring, all the families of the earth will be blessed”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn371" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref371"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>371</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Families, nations, ALL. But that same God is the one who later sends
Shaul to kill everything, even the cat, literally, of the descendants of
Amalek, which would look like that little family or nation is not part
of that "ALL" either. Ofcourse the family of Amalek is not the only one,
there are also the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the
Canaanite, Hivite, Jebusite, and a few other families and nations that
do NOT seem very blessed by that same God who promises to bless ALL
families and nations, because throughout history He ordains to destroy
them and ERASE them from the face of the EARTH. And if their inhabitants
are going to suffer a conscious, permanent and eternal torture, for the
centuries of the centuries, after the resurrection of the dead, well,
that REALLY doesn't sound like a blessing.</p>
<p>The problem is the same as Adam's, trying to eat from the tree of
KNOWLEDGE of good and evil without knowing the TRUTH, without knowing
Jesus Christ. And to know Jesus Christ is to live with Him and in Him.
But it all begins by believing in Him. Jesus Christ is a descendant of
Jacob, of Israel, who is the grandson of Abraham, the one of the
promise. And if Jesus Christ rose from the dead then EVERYONE is going
to rise on the last day and by Him ALL things in heaven and earth will
be reconciled. <strong>“<strong>I</strong>n your offspring
<strong>ALL</strong> the nations of the earth will be blessed” <a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>372</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<h5 id="moses_DOT_"><span id="anchor-142"></span>Moses.</h5>
<p>Moses writes in the book of Genesis about Jacob and Esau that: BEFORE
they were born, God had already decided that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong>he elder shall serve the
younger<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn373" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref373" role="doc-noteref"><sup>373</sup></a></strong></strong>.
And that it is written <strong><strong>"I loved Jacob; but Esau I hated”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn374" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref374"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>374</sup></a></strong></strong>. Before neither
Jacob nor Esau had done anything good or bad, God had already decided.
God decides BEFORE things happen.</p>
<p>Moses writes in Exodus 4 that: when Moses had not even gone out to
Egypt to see the Pharaoh, YHWH has already announced that the Pharaoh:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e will not let the
people go” </strong><strong><a href="#fn375" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref375" role="doc-noteref"><sup>375</sup></a></strong></strong>.
because <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> will harden
Pharaoh’s heart<strong>" </strong><strong><a href="#fn376"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref376"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>376</sup></a></strong></strong>. YHWH had
already decided to harden Pharaoh's heart so that he would not let the
people go. God decides BEFORE things happen.</p>
<p>And Paul explains to us in Romans 11, <strong>“For God has bound
<strong>ALL</strong> to disobedience, that he might have mercy on
<strong>ALL</strong>. Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and
the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways
past tracing out! ‘For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has
been his counselor? Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid
to him again?’ For of him, and through him, and to him are
<strong>ALL</strong> things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen” <a
href="#fn377" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref377"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>377</sup></a></strong>. It was God himself who
bound EVERYONE into disobedience. God decides BEFORE things happen.</p>
<p>Jehovah announces from the beginning what happens at the end, because
he already knows the end and decided it from the beginning.</p>
<p>In Deuteronomy 29 and 30, another of the books written by Moses, YHWH
announces that after Israel conquers the promised land and obey, they
will become disobedient, and that after they disobey, He, Yahweh will
scatter them, cast them out, and banish them through all the nations of
the earth, and that after they repent, being in all these nations and
peoples, He, YHWH, will gather them again even from the farthest parts
under the sky <a href="#fn378" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref378"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>378</sup></a>.</p>
<p>That is to say, Moses writes what Jehovah commands him to announce:
all Israel’s history from Moses to 1948 when Jehovah did exactly that
and formed the present nation of Israel in one day. Something that was
unimaginable, just some 200 years ago, to anyone who did not believe in
the Creator of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>And just after announcing all this, in the same Deuteronomy written
by Moses, YHWH, Jehovah, God, tells us that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>Y</strong>ahweh your God will
circumcise your heart, and the heart of your offspring, to love Yahweh
your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may
live<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn379" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref379" role="doc-noteref"><sup>379</sup></a></strong></strong>.
Who?, Who is the one that circumcises the heart? Yahweh. Yahweh is who
changes the heart. What for? So that they obey Him and live. And what
does he announce later, also in Deuteronomy 30? That:
<strong><strong>“You shall return and obey Yahweh’s voice, and do all
his commandments which I command you today” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn380" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref380"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>380</sup></a></strong></strong>. Undeserved
Grace. Undeserved gift. For love to himself. The same as he did with the
pagans by giving us his Holy Spirit through the death of Jesus Christ on
the cross.</p>
<p><strong>“For God has bound <strong>ALL</strong> to disobedience, that
he might have mercy on <strong>ALL” </strong><a href="#fn381"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref381"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>381</sup></a></strong> through his son Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>In the end everything will be as announced from the beginning. Like
that bush on fire that Moses saw. We will be branches of a bush, of a
true vine, burning with the holy fire of the Holy Spirit, which does not
quench, that burns for all eternity, and that sanctifies us to be one in
the Son and in the Father.</p>
<p>We did not choose YHWH. It was HE who chose us from the beginning. He
was the one who loved us first, EVERYONE, everybody, all of us.</p>
<h5 id="psalmists_DOT_"><span id="anchor-143"></span>Psalmists.</h5>
<p>Throughout all the Psalms the biblical teaching of this presentation
is repeated.</p>
<p>Let’s remember that Psalm 37 says that the wicked will be cut down,
that they wither, that they will be cut off, that they will not be, that
you will diligently consider their place and it shall not, that their
day is coming, that their sword will enter their own hearts, that they
will perish, that they <span id="anchor-144"></span>consume away like
smoke, that they will pass away, that you sought them and did not find
them, that they will be destroyed <a href="#fn382" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref382" role="doc-noteref"><sup>382</sup></a>.</p>
<p>And remember that Psalm 9 has a similar tone, it speaks of the
destruction of the wicked forever and ever. Other psalms call or
announce also the destruction of the wicked. Among them are Psalm 10,
12, 18, 21, 28, 52, 58, 59, 63, 73, 92. That is, there are several
psalms that speak of the destruction of the wicked.</p>
<p>There are others psalms that tell us about the mechanism. It is by
fire that silver gets refined. Psalm 66 says of the people of Israel
that: <strong>“For you, God, have tested us. You have refined us, as
silver is refined. You brought us into prison. You laid a burden on our
backs. You allowed men to ride over our heads. We went through
<strong>FIRE</strong> and through water, but you brought us to the place
of abundance” <a href="#fn383" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref383"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>383</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 21 says of the
enemies of God that: <strong>“Your hand will find out all of your
enemies. Your right hand will find out those who hate you. You will make
them as a <strong>FIERY</strong> furnace in the time of your anger.
Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath. The <strong>FIRE</strong>
shall devour them. You will destroy their descendants from the earth,
their posterity from among the children of men” <a href="#fn384"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref384"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>384</sup></a></strong>. Psalms 18, 29, 50, 68,
83, 89, 97, 104, 140 <a href="#fn385" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref385"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>385</sup></a> and others refer to YHWH's fire
that destroys the wicked and the enemies of God. And let us remember
that we ALL start as enemies, because there is no one good but God!</p>
<p>And what is the result of said destruction? Psalm 45 says that:
<strong>“I will make your name to be remembered in <strong>ALL</strong>
generations. Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and
ever” <a href="#fn386" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref386"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>386</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 22:
<strong>“ALL the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh.
ALL the relatives of the nations shall worship before you” <a
href="#fn387" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref387"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>387</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 47 <strong>“Oh
clap your hands, ALL you nations. Shout to God with the voice of
triumph!" <a href="#fn388" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref388"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>388</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 65
<strong>“You who hear prayer, ALL men will come to you” <a href="#fn389"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref389"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>389</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 67:
<strong>“let the peoples praise you, God. Let ALL the peoples praise
you” <a href="#fn390" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref390"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>390</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 72
<strong>“Yes, ALL kings shall fall down before him. ALL nations shall
serve him” <a href="#fn391" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref391"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>391</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 96
<strong>“Sing to Yahweh a new song! Sing to Yahweh, ALL the earth” <a
href="#fn392" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref392"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>392</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 97
<strong>"The heavens declare his righteousness. ALL the peoples have
seen his glory” <a href="#fn393" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref393"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>393</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 98
<strong>“Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, ALL the earth! Burst out and
sing for joy, yes, sing praises!” <a href="#fn394" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref394" role="doc-noteref"><sup>394</sup></a></strong>. And the
Psalm 99 <strong>“Yahweh is great in Zion. He is high above ALL the
peoples” <a href="#fn395" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref395"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>395</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 102
<strong>“So the nations will fear Yahweh’s name, ALL the kings of the
earth your glory” <a href="#fn396" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref396"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>396</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 117
<strong>“Praise Yahweh, ALL you nations! Extol him, ALL you peoples!” <a
href="#fn397" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref397"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>397</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 136
<strong>“who gives food to EVERY creature; for his loving kindness
endures forever” <a href="#fn398" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref398"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>398</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 145
<strong>“My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh. Let ALL
<strong>FLESH</strong> bless his holy name forever and ever” <a
href="#fn399" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref399"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>399</sup></a></strong>. And Psalm 148
<strong>“kings of the earth and ALL peoples; princes and ALL judges of
the earth” <a href="#fn400" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref400"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>400</sup></a></strong>. Are we getting clear? Or
do we have to read all the psalms?. It's ALL FLESH. That is the
promise.</p>
<p>Obviously this can only be fulfilled after the physical resurrection
of ALL the dead. Otherwise it would be like a “few”, or “some”, or the
"majority", or "all" of a given moment, but not ALL, like in EVERYONE,
everybody, all of us, like in all of those who have lived, are alive and
will physically live in this planet. And EVERYONE, everybody, all of us
is what the God of EVERYONE, everybody, all of us, promises.</p>
<h5 id="isaiah_DOT_"><span id="anchor-145"></span>Isaiah.</h5>
<p>The song in Isaiah 25 says that: <strong>"In this mountain, Yahweh of
Armies will make ALL peoples a feast of choice meat, a feast of choice
wines, of choice meat full of marrow, of well refined choice wines. He
will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers
ALL peoples, and the veil that is spread over ALL nations. He has
SWALLOWED up death FOREVER! The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from
off ALL faces. He will take the reproach of his people away from off ALL
the earth, for Yahweh has spoken it. It shall be said in that day,
'Behold, this is our God! We have waited for him, and he will save us!
This is Yahweh! We have waited for him. We will be glad and rejoice in
his salvation!'” <a href="#fn401" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref401"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>401</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Refined choice wines, first He refines us. He will destroy the veil,
the lie, that covers all peoples. He will swallow up death forever and
then will wipe away tears from off ALL faces. And then we'll be glad and
rejoice in His Yeshua, in His Salvation. That is the hebrew word.</p>
<p>In Isaiah 52 <strong>“Yahweh has made his holy arm bare in the eyes
of <strong>ALL</strong> the nations. <strong>ALL</strong> the ends of
the earth have seen the salvation of our God” <a href="#fn402"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref402"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>402</sup></a></strong>. And that “salvation” is
the word Yeshua, the proper name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in
hebrew. All the ends of the earth will see Yeshua.</p>
<p>In Isaiah 40 <strong>“Yahweh’s glory shall be revealed, and
<strong>ALL</strong> <strong>FLESH</strong> shall see it together; for
the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it” <a href="#fn403" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref403" role="doc-noteref"><sup>403</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Another way of spiritually saying exactly the same thing as in Isaiah
9, where Jehovah states that <strong>“<strong>F</strong>or the passion
of Jehovah of hosts the land is on fire and the <strong>people</strong>
are the fuel. <strong>F</strong>ire <strong>from</strong> man to brother
without leaving anyone” <a href="#fn404" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref404" role="doc-noteref"><sup>404</sup></a></strong>. These type
of spiritual statements cause interesting reactions, Isaiah 33 tells us
that: <strong>“The sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the
godless ones. Who among us can live with the devouring
<strong>FIRE</strong>? Who among us can live with
<strong>EVERLASTING</strong> burning?" <a href="#fn405"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref405"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>405</sup></a></strong>. An gigantic valley of
fire. A Ge-Henna of fire. A lake of fire.</p>
<p>Of course, this can only happen if what Isaiah 26 affirms is true,
and only until it is fulfilled, that: <strong>“Your dead shall live. My
dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for
your dew is like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast out the
departed spirits” <a href="#fn406" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref406"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>406</sup></a></strong>. After those who dwell in
the dust are awaken. After the resurrection of the dead. And then, those
awaken ones, will sing and praise their Savior. Because Jehovah tells us
in Isaiah 45 that: <strong>“Look to me, and be saved, ALL the ends of
the earth; for I am God, and there is no other. I have sworn by myself.
The word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and will not be
revoked, that to me EVERY knee shall bow, EVERY tongue shall take an
oath. They will say of me, ‘There is righteousness and strength only in
Yahweh.’ Even to him will men come. ALL those who raged against him will
be disappointed” <a href="#fn407" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref407"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>407</sup></a></strong>. That means, EVERYONE,
everybody, all of us, will bend the knee, on our own free will, out of
love for the one that saved us.</p>
<h5 id="jeremiah_DOT_"><span id="anchor-146"></span>Jeremiah.</h5>
<p>In Jeremiah 24, Jehovah says that: <strong>“I will give them a heart
to know me, that I am Yahweh. They will be my people, and I will be
their God; for they will return to me with their whole heart” <a
href="#fn408" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref408"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>408</sup></a></strong>. And in Jeremiah 31
Jehovah also says that: <strong>“I will put my law in their inward
parts, and I will write it in their heart. I will be their God, and they
shall be my people” <a href="#fn409" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref409"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>409</sup></a></strong>. And in Jeremiah 32
Jehovah says: <strong>“I will give them one heart and one way, that they
may fear me forever, for their good, and the good of their children
after them. I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will
not turn away from following them, to do them good. I will put my fear
in their hearts, that they may not depart from me” <a href="#fn410"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref410"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>410</sup></a></strong>. In other words, first
YHWH gives a heart, He writes his law on that heart, He also gives one
way, He puts His fear in that heart, and AFTER that, man can turn,
repent, obey, love YHWH, and NOT depart from Him. It is Jehovah who
makes us want to do all those things.</p>
<p>After that, in Jeremiah 33, Jehovah promises that: <strong>“I will
cleanse them from ALL their iniquity by which they have sinned against
me. I will pardon ALL their iniquities by which they have sinned against
me and by which they have transgressed against me. This city will be to
me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before ALL the nations
of the earth, which will hear ALL the good that I do to them, and will
fear and tremble for ALL the good and for ALL the peace that I provide
to it” <a href="#fn411" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref411"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>411</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>First He cleanses us from ALL the evil with which we sin against Him
and THEN He forgives us ALL our sins. And above all He gives us so much
peace and He does us so much good that ALL the peoples of the earth will
tremble with all the good and all the peace that He will provide us.</p>
<p>To think that Adam screwed all humanity but Christ only reconciled,
or only saved, or could only draw a few unto Him, because the rest did
not accepted Him, or did not trust Him, it’s like thinking that a mother
who decides to change diapers to her newborn baby, because he pooped,
later changes her mind and decides not to change him, or it's too hard
for her to change him, because her baby started crying, or because he
kicked her, or because he piss her all over in the process. It’s like
thinking that the will of the baby will overcome the will of the mother.
And of course the comparison is an exaggeration because, proportionally,
the will of God is incomprehensibly bigger than ours, and a mother's
will is just a little bigger than the baby's. And God's love for us is
also much grater than that of the mother for her baby.</p>
<p>He is in control, Jehovah is God of everything. He owns the sky and
the earth. EVERY knee will bow because he is going to give us a heart
that will want to bend it out of love for Him.</p>
<h5 id="ezekiel_DOT_"><span id="anchor-147"></span>Ezekiel.</h5>
<p>Jehovah says in Ezekiel 11 that: <strong>“I will give them one heart,
and I will put a new spirit within you. I will take the stony heart out
of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh; that they may walk
in my statutes, and keep my ordinances, and do them. They will be my
people, and I will be their God” <a href="#fn412" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref412" role="doc-noteref"><sup>412</sup></a></strong>. And in
Ezekiel 36 he says that: <strong>“I will also give you a new heart, and
I will put a new spirit within you. I will take away the stony heart out
of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh. I will put my
Spirit within you, and <strong>CAUSE</strong> you to walk in my
statutes. You will keep my ordinances and do them” <a href="#fn413"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref413"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>413</sup></a></strong>. Y In Ezekiel 37 it says
that: <strong>"I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live” <a
href="#fn414" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref414"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>414</sup></a></strong>. It is Jehovah who gives
a heart capable of walking in His ordinances. He removes the old heart
of stone and gives us a new one of flesh. Then He puts His spirit on us
and it is Jehovah who CAUSES us to walk in His statutes and do His
ordinances.</p>
<p>The bible likes to repeat to make things clear.</p>
<p>It also tells us about the mechanism. In Ezekiel 22 it says that:
<strong>“As they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the
middle of the furnace, to blow the FIRE on it, to melt it; so I will
gather you in my anger and in my wrath, and I will lay you there, and
melt you. Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you with the FIRE of my
wrath, and you will be MELTED in the middle of it. As silver is MELTED
in the middle of the furnace, so you will be MELTED in the middle of it;
and you will know that I, Yahweh, have poured out my wrath on you” <a
href="#fn415" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref415"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>415</sup></a></strong>. It is with fire. The
same one John the Baptist tells us about.</p>
<h5 id="daniel_DOT_"><span id="anchor-148"></span>Daniel.</h5>
<p>In the vision of Daniel 7, to a Son of Man <strong>"Dominion was
given him, and glory, and a kingdom, that <strong>ALL</strong> the
peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an
everlasting dominion, which will not pass away, and his kingdom one that
which will not be destroyed” <a href="#fn416" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref416" role="doc-noteref"><sup>416</sup></a></strong>. It says
ALL, but some believe that it is just a part, a majority, a selection,
but not all. Some believe that Sodom is not counted there, or not even
all of Israel, only part of it. And according to this same vision at the
end, <strong>"The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the
kingdoms under the <strong>WHOLE</strong> sky, will be given to the
people of the saints of the Most High. His kingdom is an everlasting
kingdom, and <strong>ALL</strong> dominions will serve and obey him” <a
href="#fn417" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref417"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>417</sup></a></strong>. It’s EVERYONE,
everybody, all of us.</p>
<p>But some people believe that it is the kingdom of some, that there
are domains that will not serve Him, that love does not overcome hate in
some cases. that goodness does not defeat evil in some cases. That the
will of some is greater than that of the Creator of Heaven and Earth. He
didn’t want to. Too bad. In that case there is nothing God can do about
it.</p>
<p>It is like thinking that a barely crawling baby, who is heading for a
huge fire, and that I, the loving father of the baby, who warns him and
points out the fire, and warns him of the danger, but the baby is still
on his way to the fire and he doesn't understand me, or he doesn't want
to understand me, or he doesn't pay attention to me, or he doesn't obeys
me, and then, I in my "great love" for my baby and my "great respect”
for his decision and for his will, I decide to let him follow his path.
I love him so much that I let him get into the fire. Absurd right?, but
that's what some believe.</p>
<p>Of course it is not a fair comparison, because God allows us even to
die, and then He resurrects us ALL. And He gives us ALL his Spirit. Of
course not all at the same time, some who were the first will be the
last and others who were last have been first. Some after the physical
resurrection.</p>
<h5 id="the-12_DOT_"><span id="anchor-149"></span>The 12.</h5>
<p>Hosea 6 says that <strong>“Come! Let’s return to Yahweh; for he has
torn us to pieces, and he will heal us; he has injured us, and he will
bind up our wounds. After two days he will revive us. On the third day
he will raise us up, and we will live before him. Let’s acknowledge
Yahweh. Let’s press on to know Yahweh. As surely as the sun rises,
Yahweh will appear. He will come to us like the rain, like the spring
rain that waters the earth” <a href="#fn418" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref418" role="doc-noteref"><sup>418</sup></a></strong>. But no,
some people think that this is only for Israel and not for the millions
of pagans that ended up believing in the Meshiakh of Israel. And in
Hosea 13 <strong>“I will ransom them from the power of Sheol. I will
redeem them from death! Death, where are your plagues? Sheol, where is
your destruction?” <a href="#fn419" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref419"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>419</sup></a></strong>. And Paul explains in 1
Corinthians 15 that this text refers to the resurrection of the dead and
the life in the Holy Spirit. The one that is for EVERYONE. As YHWH
himself explains in Joel 2: <strong>“I will pour out my Spirit on ALL
<strong>FLESH</strong>” <a href="#fn420" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref420" role="doc-noteref"><sup>420</sup></a></strong>. ALL
FLESH.</p>
<p>And in Obadiah Yahweh himself says <strong>"For the day of Yahweh is
near <strong>ALL</strong> the nations!” <a href="#fn421"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref421"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>421</sup></a></strong>. No one escapes, Jehovah
explains it to us also in Amos 9 <strong>“Though they dig into Sheol,
there my hand will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there
I will bring them down. Though they hide themselves in the top of
Carmel, I will search and take them out from there; and though they be
hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the
serpent, and it will bite them” <a href="#fn422" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref422" role="doc-noteref"><sup>422</sup></a></strong>. And He
tells us that when He rebuilds the fallen tabernacle of David he does so
<strong>“that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and
<strong>ALL</strong> the nations who are called by my name” <a
href="#fn423" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref423"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>423</sup></a></strong>. In Micah it also says
that <strong>“Hear, you peoples, ALL of you. Listen, O earth, and ALL
that is therein: and let the Lord Yahweh be witness against you, the
Lord from his holy temple. For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place,
and will come down and tread on the high places of the earth. The
mountains MELT under him, and the valleys split apart, like wax before
the FIRE, like waters that are poured down a steep place” <a
href="#fn424" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref424"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>424</sup></a></strong>. The fire is for
EVERYONE. In Nahum 1 states <strong>“The mountains quake before him, and
the hills MELT away. The earth trembles at his presence, yes, the world,
and ALL who dwell in it. Who can stand before his indignation? Who can
endure the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like FIRE,
and the rocks are broken apart by him” <a href="#fn425"

<p>But some people think "that's not for me", "that's for others", "I am
very good because Christ lives in me”, and “I accepted Him”, and “I
decided”, and “I searched for Him”, and they seem to forget that it is
not about what they do or not do but what God does in them.</p>
<p>In Zephaniah 1, Jehovah tells us that <strong>“I will utterly sweep
away <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> from the surface of the earth, says
Yahweh. I will sweep away man and animal. I will sweep away the birds of
the sky, the fish of the sea, and the heaps of rubble with the wicked. I
will cut off man from the surface of the earth, says Yahweh” <a
href="#fn426" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref426"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>426</sup></a></strong>. That's why we are NEW
creatures in Jesus Christ. Either before or after the physical
resurrection of ALL the dead. Because the old is destroyed physically
and spiritually and forever. ETERNALLY. That's why in Zephaniah 3
affirms that <strong>“For then I will purify the lips of the peoples,
that they may <strong>ALL</strong> call on Yahweh’s name, to serve him
shoulder to shoulder” <a href="#fn427" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref427" role="doc-noteref"><sup>427</sup></a></strong>. Shoulder
to shoulder. For your own good. Who does the little matter? Jehovah
purifies the lips. What for? So that they may call on the name of
Jehovah. Who? EVERYONE.</p>
<p>The bible likes to repeat. So that things are clear.</p>
<p>In Haggai 2 we are told that: <strong>“For thus says the Lord of
hosts: Once more (it is a little while) I will shake heaven and earth,
the sea and dry land; and I will shake ALL nations, and they shall come
to the Desire of ALL Nations, and I will fill this temple with glory,
says the Lord of hosts. The silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, says
the Lord of hosts. The glory of this latter temple shall be greater than
the former, says the Lord of hosts. And in this place I will give peace,
says the Lord of hosts” <a href="#fn428" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref428" role="doc-noteref"><sup>428</sup></a></strong>. How many?
ALL. An what will He give? Peace. But no. It just can't be. There must
be some mistake. That is what some people think. Finally what? Do we
believe the scriptures or not?</p>
<p>In Zechariah 9, speaking of a just and saving King who comes humble
riding on a donkey, white it is hen lays it, guess who Zechariah is
talking about, tells us that: <strong>“his dominion will be from sea to
sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth” <a href="#fn429"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref429"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>429</sup></a></strong>. And no, it doesn't say
ALL, but it says to the ENDS.</p>
<p>And in Malachi 3, also speaking of his Meshiakh, He tells us that:
<strong>“But who can endure the day of his coming? And who will stand
when he appears? For he is like a refiner’s <strong>FIRE</strong>, and
like launderer's soap” <a href="#fn430" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref430" role="doc-noteref"><sup>430</sup></a></strong>. And He
reaffirms in Malachi 4 that: <strong>“For, behold, the day comes, it
burns as a furnace; and <strong>ALL</strong> the proud, and
<strong>ALL</strong> who work wickedness, will be stubble; and the day
that comes will burn them up, says Yahweh of Armies, that it shall leave
them neither root nor branch” <a href="#fn431" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref431" role="doc-noteref"><sup>431</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Jehovah using the 12 minor prophets, repeats us again and again the
same idea. It’s EVERYONE, everybody, all of us.</p>
<h5 id="jesus-christ_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-150"></span>Jesus Christ.</h5>
<p>In Matthew 5 and in Luke 6, Jesus Christ tells us not to get angry,
not to look with greed, not to divorce, if you say "yes" let it be "yes"
and if you say “no” let it be “no”, to not resist the bad guy, to turn
the other cheek, to deliver not only the tunic that they want to take
but also the cloak, to carry two miles the load that someone forced us
to carry one mile, that if they ask you give, to not to refuse to lend,
to love the enemy, to pray for those who persecute us <a href="#fn432"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref432"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>432</sup></a>, to do good to those who hate us,
to bless the one who curses us, to pray for the one who mistreats us,
not to ask back something that was taken from us, to lend without
expecting profit <a href="#fn433" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref433"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>433</sup></a>. And he explains that so
<strong>“that you may be children of your Father who is in heaven. For
he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the
just and the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do
you have? Don’t even the tax collectors do the same? If you only greet
your friends, what more do you do than others? Don’t even the tax
collectors do the same? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your
Father in heaven is perfect” <a href="#fn434" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref434" role="doc-noteref"><sup>434</sup></a></strong>. Perfect
like your Father. Not only it is what he asks of us, it’s also what He
himself does. God loves his enemies, God turns the other cheek, God goes
the extra mile, God gives if asked for, God gives more than what they
want to take away.</p>
<p>Why do some people think that God does not do what He demands of his
creatures? That God does not love his enemies, that which was EVERY
believer before being a believer? Or is it that they were NEVER enemies
of God? Because NOBODY starts being God’s friend.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ in Luke 15 asks us <strong>"Which of you men, if you had
one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine
in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost,
<strong>UNTIL</strong> he found it?” <a href="#fn435"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref435"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>435</sup></a></strong>. Jesus Christ, in John
10, tells us that <strong>"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd
<strong>LAYS</strong> <strong>DOWN</strong> his life for the sheep” <a
href="#fn436" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref436"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>436</sup></a></strong>. He affirms us that He
would do just that: look for the lost sheep, the one lost in PERDITION,
until He finds it. Listen: UNTIL He finds it.</p>
<p>That is why He also affirms, in John 12, that: <strong>“And I, if I
am lifted up from the earth, will draw <strong>ALL</strong> peoples to
Myself” <a href="#fn437" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref437"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>437</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>If God says ALL, it is ALL, everyone, everybody, all of us, TODOS,
toditos , todos.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ affirms in Matthew 11 that:
<strong>“<strong>ALL</strong> <strong>THINGS</strong> have been
delivered to Me by My Father” <a href="#fn438" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref438" role="doc-noteref"><sup>438</sup></a></strong>. And in
John 6, Jesus Christ affirms that: <strong>“ALL that the Father gives Me
will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by NO MEANS cast
out. For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the
will of Him who sent Me. This is the will of the Father who sent Me,
that <strong>OF</strong> ALL He has given Me I should lose NOTHING” <a
href="#fn439" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref439"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>439</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>ALL THINGS was given to Him and the will of the one who sent Him is
that He does not lose ANYTHING of ALL that was given to Him. And ALL the
Father gives Him will go to Him and He will by NO MEANS cast out.</p>
<p>But no, there are some people who claim to believe and love the
Heavenly Father, and to have chosen Him, and elected Him, and trusted
Him, on their own, but that little thing about "ALL": that’s too much,
that just can’t be. Because they think that the will of the CLAY POT
will overcome the will of the POTTER!</p>
<p>Fortunately YHWH is not a God of confusion.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ explains to Nicodemus that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>E</strong><strong>xcept a man be born
again, he cannot see the kingdom of God”</strong></strong> <a
href="#fn440" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref440"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>440</sup></a> and
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>T</strong>hat which is born of the
flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is
spirit<strong>”</strong></strong> <a href="#fn441" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref441" role="doc-noteref"><sup>441</sup></a>. Nobody chooses to
BE BORN, nobody seeks to be born, nobody does ANYTHING to be born, one
gets born, the first time by the mother in the flesh and the second time
by the heavenly Father in the Spirit. That is why Jesus Christ explains,
in John 6, that <strong><strong>”</strong><strong>N</strong><strong>o
one can come to me unless the Father who sent me” </strong><strong><a

<p>If it is true that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us <a

of sin <a href="#fn445" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref445"

and from the weak God chose to shame the strong <a href="#fn448"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref448"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>448</sup></a>; if all that Paul says is true, if
you really believe it: Who do you think you were before you became a
Christian, or what did you do, or who did you trust, or what did you
repent of, or what did you decide, or achieved, or chose, or accept, or
search for, to deserve that the God, creator of Heaven and Earth, would
CHOOSE you to believe in his Son Jesus Christ and accept Him before your
physical death? Don't you think that the same God who chose from the
worst of this world can also choose, when He pleases, to GET BORN of the
Spirit the one who has not yet chosen? Even after the physical
resurrection of ALL the dead?</p>
<p>Because that is what Paul is talking about.</p>
<p>1 Timothy 2 says that God wants <strong>“ALL people to be saved and

<h5 id="peter_DOT_"><span id="anchor-152"></span>Peter.</h5>
<p>In 1st Peter 4 it says <strong>“Beloved, don’t be astonished at the
FIERY trial which has come upon you to test you, as though a strange
thing happened to you” <a href="#fn463" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref463" role="doc-noteref"><sup>463</sup></a></strong>. And adds
<strong>“But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be
ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter. For the time has come
for JUDGMENT to begin with the household of God. If it BEGINS first WITH
US, what will happen to those who don’t obey the Good News of God?" <a
href="#fn464" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref464"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>464</sup></a></strong>. The fire, that of the
Ge-Henna, that which they translated "hell" is for everyone, don't be
surprised by that. The judgment, that of Ge-Henna, that which is
translated "hell", begins with the believers, with God’s household. Only
that for the believer, neither to the fire, nor to the judgment, it’s
called Ge-Henna, but it’s called the Holy Spirit. This is so, because
the effect is the opposite. In the case of the Holy Spirit it is Life
and Life in abundance.</p>
<p>Of course, the fire is not only spiritual. In 2nd Peter 3 it says
that <strong>"the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements
will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that
are in it will be burned up. Therefore since all these things will be
destroyed like this, what kind of people ought you to be in holy living
and godliness, looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day
of God, which will cause the burning heavens to be dissolved, and the
elements will melt with fervent heat? But, according to his promise, we
look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells” <a
href="#fn465" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref465"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>465</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>According to Jesus Christ, after the resurrection we will be like the
angels <a href="#fn466" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref466"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>466</sup></a>, and according to Daniel 3 <a
href="#fn467" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref467"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>467</sup></a> and Judges 13 <a href="#fn468"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref468"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>468</sup></a>, the body of the angels is
resistant to physical fire. So an eternal physical fire is the least of
worries for a resurrected person. In that new earth with that new
heavens, we will ALL have a body like that of the angels, that’s what
Jesus Christ said.</p>
<p>What everyone who does not believe in Jesus Christ should worry
about, all those infidels, all those unjust, all those wicked, is of
that spiritual fire that promises to destroy them, finish them,
disappear them, vanish them, to the point that they are going to look
for them and they will not find them <a href="#fn469"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref469"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>469</sup></a>. <strong>"<strong>For
</strong>whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will
lose his life for my sake will find it” <a href="#fn470"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref470"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>470</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>This earth and these heavens will pass away. It's in that new earth
with those new heavens where ALL will be made alive, both physically and
spiritually. That is what Peter expects and what should expect every
believer in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In 2nd Peter 3 it says that: the Lord is <strong>"not wishing that
<strong>ANYONE</strong> should perish, but that <strong>ALL</strong>
should come to repentance” <a href="#fn471" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref471" role="doc-noteref"><sup>471</sup></a></strong>. Why do
some people believe that their "wishing" to remain spiritually dead is
greater than the "wishing" of YHWH? The only explanation is that they
are still partially dead, spiritually, to The Truth.</p>
<p>God does not save by avoiding death. God saves BY TAKING US OUT of
death. Some are taken out of spiritual death first, so that they can
repent, and later are taken out of physical death. And others are taken
out first from physical death and then taken out of spiritual death, so
that they can repent. But it’s to EVERYONE, everybody, all of us, that
He takes us out of, both physical and spiritual death.</p>

<p>Revelation 4 says that: <strong>“Worthy are you, our Lord and God,

on the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever!” <a href="#fn473"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref473"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>473</sup></a></strong>. But some people imagine
that "EVERY creature" does not include the majority of men, because most
of them will be somewhere else saying who knows what to who knows whom.
Meaning: the stars YES, because "ALL that are in them" include the
stars, but the one who didn't want to, IMPOSSIBLE. Because they believe
that the will of the CLAY POT will overcome the will of the POTTER!</p>
<p>Revelation 15 says: <strong>“Who wouldn’t fear you, Lord, and glorify

<h4 id="it-is-written_DOT_"><span id="anchor-154"></span>It is written.</h4>
<p>It is written: <strong>"The Father loves the Son, and has given

href="#fn476" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref476"

<p>It is written: <strong>“ALL THINGS were made by him; and without him
was not any thing made that was made” <a href="#fn477"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref477"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>477</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>It is written: <strong>“by his Son, whom he appointed heir of ALL
THINGS, through whom also he made the worlds. His Son is the radiance of
his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding ALL THINGS by
the word of his power” <a href="#fn478" class="footnote-ref"

that is not subject to him” <a href="#fn479" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref479" role="doc-noteref"><sup>479</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>So far very few believers in Yeshua, Jesus Christ; would dispute that
on these verses “ALL THINGS” means “ALL THINGS”, and that “NOTHING”
means “NOTHING”.</p>
<p>It is written: Jesus Christ <strong>“Who is the image of the
invisible God, the firstborn of EVERY creature: For by him were ALL
THINGS created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
powers: ALL THINGS were created by him, and for him: And he is before
ALL THINGS, and by him ALL THINGS consist. And he is the head of the
body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead;
that in ALL THINGS he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the
Father that in him should ALL fulness dwell; And, having made peace
through the blood of his cross, by him to RECONCILE ALL THINGS unto
himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in
heaven” <a href="#fn480" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref480"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>480</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In this text from Colossians 1, some believers would begin to think
that “ALL THINGS” means “ALL THINGS” and that “ALL” means “ALL” except
in the last “ALL”. Because if that "reconcile" is of ALL things, that
would include ALL creatures, and that would include ALL sinners. And
that would be too much.</p>
<p>It is written: <strong>“But now is Christ risen from the dead, and
become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death,
by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam ALL die,
even so in Christ shall ALL be made alive. But every man in his own
order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his
coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom
to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down ALL rule and ALL
authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put ALL enemies
under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he
hath put ALL THINGS under his feet. But when he saith ALL THINGS are put
under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put ALL THINGS
under him. And when ALL THINGS shall be subdued unto him, then shall the
Son also himself be subject unto him that put ALL THINGS under him, that
God may be ALL in ALL” <a href="#fn481" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref481" role="doc-noteref"><sup>481</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>But no. In this text from 1 Corinthians 15, some believers have to
start juggling so that “ALL” means “SOME” or “FEW”. And of course they
are included in those “SOME” or “FEW”.</p>
<p>It is written: <strong>"For God has bound ALL to disobedience, that
he might have mercy on ALL. Oh the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and
his ways past tracing out! For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or
who has been his counselor? Or who has first given to him, and it will
be repaid to him again? For of him, and through him, and to him are ALL
THINGS. To him be the glory for ever!” <a href="#fn482"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref482"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>482</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>But no. Some believers believe that in this text from Romans 11, most
of the glory goes to someone else.</p>
<p>It is written: The Father of glory showed his power <strong>“in
Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right
hand in the heavenly places, Far above ALL principality, and power, and
might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this

<p>Why do some people think that the victory of Jesus Christ on the
Cross is as a victory of a roman caesar? That at the end of time some
resurrected will have to bend that knee against their will, that it's
going to be like when the older brother bends the younger brother's arm
and force him to say something? It's like imagining the risen person
forced to bend the knee against his will and Jesus Christ saying: “Who
is the king of kings? Who? WHO? Who is the king? AHA ! Now GO TO
HELL!”</p>
<p>That is NOT the victory of Jesus Christ on ANY of his subjects. All
of us who have him as King do it on our own free will after the Heavenly
Father has changed our stone heart for a tender one so that we may love
Him above all things for our own good. That was his promise and He is
keeping it.</p>
<p>It is written: <strong>“And EVERY creature which is in heaven, and on
the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and ALL that
are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power,
be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for
<strong>EVER</strong> and <strong>EVER</strong>” <a href="#fn501"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref501"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>501</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway. We could end up studying the whole bible. The point is that
the promise is for everyone. Obviously that hasn't happened yet because
otherwise there would not be anyone of those who think that the thing is
only for a few ones, among which, of course, are themselves.</p>
<p>In addition, the promise of physical and spiritual resurrection is
for everyone and that has not happened either. However that is the
promise of the living God, of the Creator of Heaven and earth: EVERYONE,
ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE. And God is not a man, that he should lie.</p>
<p>THESE are the good news. The really GOOD NEWS.</p>
<h3 id="the-return_DOT_"><span id="anchor-155"></span>The return.</h3>
<p>According to the bible, Jesus Christ announces that He is going to
return. And at the time when his disciples see Him for the last time,
two men, two angels, dressed in white remind them of the same.</p>
<p>In Acts 1, after the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ
says that:</p>
<p><strong>“Therefore when they had come together, they asked him,
'Lord, are you now restoring the kingdom to Israel?'</strong></p>
<p><strong>He said to them, 'It isn’t for you to know times or seasons
which the Father has set within his own authority. But you will receive
power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to
me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of
the earth.'</strong></p>
<p><strong>When he had said these things, as they were looking, he was
taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight. While they were
looking steadfastly into the sky as he went, behold, two men stood by
them in white clothing, who also said, 'You men of Galilee, why do you
stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who was received up from you
into the sky, will come back in the same way as you saw him going into
the sky'” <a href="#fn502" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref502"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>502</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>And in 2 Peter 3, Peter warns us that:</p>
<p><strong>“knowing this first, that in the last days mockers will come,
walking after their own lusts and saying, 'Where is the promise of his
coming? For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things
continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.' For this they
willfully forget that there were heavens from of old, and an earth
formed out of water and amid water by the word of God, by which means
the world that existed then, being overflowed with water, perished“ <a
href="#fn503" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref503"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>503</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>And when the disciples ask Jesus Christ: What sign will there be of
your coming? According to Matthew 24 and 25, the answer has several
parts. And by the answers that Jesus Christ gives the thing seems quite
dramatic and unpleasant.</p>
<p>This are the good news that do not seem so good. The return of Son of
Man is good news for everyone who does NOT love the world. The world,
according to the bible, is the current system, the one that is under the
dominion of Satan, as far as God allows it. For the world and for
everyone who loves the world, the return of the Son of Man are bad
news.</p>
<p>The return of the Son of Man is related in the books of the prophets,
in the gospels, some passages, from Paul's letters, from the letters of
Peter, and the book of Revelation. The way to understand the sequence of
events describing the return of the Son of Man has to be coherent to all
of them.</p>
<p>The general context is a time when the Meshiakh of Israel will reign
over all nations and there will be peace in all the earth. This is the
main excuse that many Jews still have to say that Jesus Christ cannot be
the Meshiakh. Where is the King of the planet? Where is that global
peace, of all the nations and peoples of the earth, promised in the
hebrew scriptures?</p>
<h4 id="warning_DOT_-2"><span id="anchor-156"></span>Warning.</h4>
<p>Until now, your host, that is to say, me, Jose Luis Quiroga, can say
that he is fairly confident, say more than 95 percent, that EVERYTHING
presented up to now is true, it is biblical, it is what the scriptures
teach. The rest is reserved, let's say that 5 per cent, to be completely
wrong. But his doubts are very little.</p>
<p>As far as this part of the future is concerned, the sequence of
events having to do with the return of the son of man, your host, me,
Jose Luis Quiroga, must admit that his confidence is reduced to 70
percent. And in some respects, the minority, say 4 of the 22 chapters of
the book of Revelation, there are great doubts as to how to understand
them coherently with the rest of the prophetic books and with the whole
bible. In these 4 chapters: 12, 13, 17 and 18, trust does not reach 10
percent. The problem is always in the details. And there are details
that are simply not clear.</p>
<p>Having made this warning, let's continue with the parts in which
there is a 70 percent confidence.</p>
<h4 id="jesus-christ_DOT_-2"><span id="anchor-157"></span>Jesus Christ.</h4>
<p>When the disciples ask Jesus Christ: What sign will there be of your
coming? In Matthew 24 <a href="#fn504" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref504" role="doc-noteref"><sup>504</sup></a>, He answers that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong>or as the lightning flashes
from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will the coming of the
Son of Man be<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn505"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref505"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>505</sup></a></strong></strong>. In Luke 17 he
answers something similar:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>f</strong><strong>or as the lightning,
when it flashes out of one part under the sky, shines to another part
under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn506" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref506"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>506</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>It also says in Matthew 24 that: <strong>"For as in those days which
were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving
in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and they
didn’t know until the flood came and took them all away, so will the
coming of the Son of Man be. Then two men will be in the field: one will
be taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding at the mill:
one will be taken and one will be left. Watch therefore, for you don’t
know in what hour your Lord comes” <a href="#fn507" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref507" role="doc-noteref"><sup>507</sup></a></strong>. And Luke
17 adds: <strong>“Likewise, even as it was in the days of Lot: they ate,
they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; but in the
day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky
and destroyed them all. It will be the same way in the day that the Son
of Man is revealed” <a href="#fn508" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref508"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>508</sup></a></strong>.
<strong>“<strong>I</strong>n that night there will be two people in one
bed. One will be taken and the other will be left” <a href="#fn509"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref509"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>509</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ returns, it will in an instant, very quickly, and
people will be having a normal life in which they drink, buy, sell,
plant, they build and marry. Maybe that's why we see happening what
Peter announced in 2nd Peter 3 that would happen, that some mockers
would say: <strong>"Where is the promise of His coming? For since the
fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning
of creation” <a href="#fn510" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref510"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>510</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<h4 id="peace_DOT_"><span id="anchor-158"></span>Peace.</h4>
<p>In Isaiah 2 it says that: <strong>“And it shall come to pass in the
last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in
the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all
nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye,
and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of
Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths:
for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from
Jerusalem. And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their
spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more” <a href="#fn511"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref511"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>511</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In Isaiah 9 it says that: <strong>"For unto us a child is born, unto
us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and
his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The
everlasting Father, The Prince of <strong>PEACE</strong>. Of the
increase of his government and peace there shall be <strong>NO</strong>
<strong>END</strong>, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to
order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
henceforth even <strong>FOR</strong> <strong>EVER</strong>. The zeal of
the Lord of hosts will perform this” <a href="#fn512"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref512"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>512</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah 33, Jehovah promises Israel that <strong>“I will cleanse
them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. I
will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me
and by which they have transgressed against me. This city will be to me
for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of
the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear
and tremble for all the good and for <strong>ALL</strong>
<strong>THE</strong> <strong>PEACE</strong> that I provide to it” <a
href="#fn513" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref513"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>513</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In Zechariah 14 that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>Y</strong>ahweh will be King over all
the earth. In that day Yahweh will be one, and his name one<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn514" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref514"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>514</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>This was what the Israelites of the time of Jesus Christ were waiting
from the Meshiakh of Israel. That He would be the king of all nations
and that there would be peace. That is the excuse that some Jews, some
genetic descendants of Abraham, still have, and insist on, to deny
Yeshua as their Meshiakh.</p>
<p>In Zechariah 14 Jehovah also says that: BEFORE He reigns,
<strong>"For I will gather <strong>ALL</strong> nations against
Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled,
and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into
captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the
city” <a href="#fn515" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref515"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>515</sup></a></strong>. And when He is REIGNING,
<strong>"EVERY ONE that is left of all the nations which came against
Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year TO WORSHIP the King, the
Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles” <a href="#fn516"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref516"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>516</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>And the country or nation that does not send emissaries every year to
worship the King during the Sukkot festival, the festival of
Tabernacles, will be in trouble, because it will not have rains.</p>
<p>When Jesus Christ, Yeshua, the Meshiakh of Israel returns there will
be PEACE and He will be the King of ALL the nations, reigning from
Israel, that Israel that is already here, that which is already a nation
since 1948.</p>
<h4 id="temple_DOT_"><span id="anchor-159"></span>Temple.</h4>
<p>In Ezekiel, 8 chapters are dedicated to describing how is the temple
that will be built when the Meshiakh of Israel reigns over all nations.
One of the most interesting features of the temple described in Ezekiel
is that it has no walls indicating separation between kinds of people as
indeed had the temple at the times of Jesus Christ. Said temple, the one
from the times of Jesus Christ, separated the genetic descendants of
Abraham from the rest of the people: the pagans. Another characteristic
of the temple described in Ezekiel is that it does NOT have a veil that
separates to the Holy of Holies as a place to which only the high priest
can enter. In this future temple EVERYONE will have access to the Holy
of the Holies.</p>
<p>This future temple is so important to the bible that only the
Tabernacle of the Meeting, which was built as YHWH showed Moses on Mount
Horeb, also known as Mount Sinai, that tent that the Israelites carried
for 40 years in the desert following a pillar of cloud by day, and a
pillar of fire by night, only that Tabernacle of the Meeting has more
pages in the bible dedicated to describe and explain it than the future
temple described in Ezekiel. That future temple seems to be, according
to the number of pages dedicated in the bible, more important than the
previous ones.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 33 <a href="#fn517" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref517"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>517</sup></a> and Isaiah 66 <a href="#fn518"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref518" role="doc-noteref"><sup>518</sup></a>
speak of the time when Jehovah will bring the Israelites back to their
land and that the people shall bring praises and presents to the house
of the Lord, to that temple which Ezekiel describes in chapters 40 to 48
of his book.</p>
<p>In that future temple, according to Ezekiel 46, offering sacrifices
will be made daily. It says that: <strong>"You shall prepare a lamb a
year old without defect for a burnt offering to Yahweh daily. Morning by
morning you shall prepare it. You shall prepare a meal offering with it
morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a
hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal offering to Yahweh
continually by a perpetual ordinance. Thus they shall prepare the lamb,
the meal offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual
burnt offering” <a href="#fn519" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref519"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>519</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Another interesting feature of this temple, according to Ezekiel 47
<a href="#fn520" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref520"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>520</sup></a>, is that water comes out of the
sanctuary of the temple that when it comes out of the temple is a small
water source that has a low flow but as it moves away from the temple,
the flow increases until it becomes a river that reaches the dead sea.
River that, because it is fresh water, makes the dead sea no longer
“dead”, and people will be able to fish in that lake that is now called
the "Dead Sea". Also, on the banks of the river, trees will grow that
will always bear fruit in time, that can be eaten, and the leaves of
said trees will never fall and will be medicinal. Perhaps because they
are medicinal is that they will never fall. They will be so desired that
the people will rip them off before they fall. And whoever bathes or
swims in that river or in what is now the "dead sea" will heal and
live.</p>
<p>That future temple is a temple such as it has never been seen on this
planet.</p>

<p>In all the prophecies of the bible the numbers are interpreted as
numbers. In Joseph's dreams 11 stars are 11 brothers <a href="#fn521"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref521"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>521</sup></a>, 3 branches are 3 days <a

href="#fn523" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref523"

years <a href="#fn524" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref524"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>524</sup></a>. In the visions of Daniel 4 beasts
are 4 empires <a href="#fn525" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref525"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>525</sup></a>, 10 horns are 10 kings <a
href="#fn526" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref526"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>526</sup></a>, 70 weeks are 70 groups of 7 years
<a href="#fn527" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref527"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>527</sup></a>, 1290 days are 1290 years, 1335
days are 1335 years <a href="#fn528" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref528"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>528</sup></a>. It never happens that 11 means
many, or some, or few. 11 is 11, not 5, not 3, not 20.</p>
<p>The book of revelation is no exception: the 7 stars are 7 angels, the
7 candlesticks are 7 churches <a href="#fn529" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref529" role="doc-noteref"><sup>529</sup></a>, the 7 seals are 7
processes or plagues <a href="#fn530" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref530"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>530</sup></a>, the 7 trumpets are 7 processes <a
href="#fn531" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref531"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>531</sup></a> and the 7 bowls are 7 processes <a
href="#fn532" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref532"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>532</sup></a>. Even in Revelation 17 the angel
explains to John that the 7 heads are 7 mountains and 7 kings <a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>534</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In the same way, the correct interpretation of Revelation 20, despite
some people not accepting it, is that when it says "a thousand years" it
is just that: <strong>“<strong>A </strong>THOUSAND YEARS” <a
href="#fn535" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref535"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>535</sup></a></strong>. A thousand are a
thousand, they are not 2 thousand, nor 4 thousand, not 3 thousand, not
“a little bit”, not “for a long time”.</p>
<p>These thousand years are a time of PEACE, in which according to
Isaiah 65 a person who dies at the age of 100 is considered a child and
people will live like the days of a tree <a href="#fn536"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref536" role="doc-noteref"><sup>536</sup></a>
and <strong>“<strong>t</strong>he wolf and the lamb shall feed together,
and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the
serpent's meat” <a href="#fn537" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref537"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>537</sup></a></strong>. According to Revelation
20, it will be a thousand years of PEACE because Satan, also called "the
ancient serpent", or "devil", he will be chained in the abyss <a
href="#fn538" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref538"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>538</sup></a>. Peace because the one who
prevents it can not act because he’s chained.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 20, <strong>“when the thousand years are
expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison” <a href="#fn539"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref539"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>539</sup></a></strong> and will deceive the
nations and surround God’s beloved city, but fire will fall from heaven
and they will be defeated.</p>
<p>At the end of these thousand years, peace ends, there is a short war
between those who follow the Lamb, Jesus Christ, and those who follow
Satan, Gog and Magog, but soon everything is destroyed by the fire that
falls from heaven.</p>
<p>Said physical fire that falls from the heaven destroys those who were
deceived by Satan. The rest of the people, those who were not deceived
by Satan, they will be transformed directly, without dying, to his
glorious body, that which is not affected by physical fire, as Paul
explains in 1st Corinthians 15 <a href="#fn540" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref540" role="doc-noteref"><sup>540</sup></a>.</p>
<p>At that time, that fire will also consume this entire planet, these
physical heavens and this physical earth that we see today, as told to
us by 2nd Peter 3: <strong>"the heavens will pass away with a great
noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the
earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore since
all these things will be destroyed like this, what kind of people ought
you to be in holy living and godliness, looking for and earnestly
desiring the coming of the day of God, which will cause the burning
heavens to be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?
But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth,
in which righteousness dwells” <a href="#fn541" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref541" role="doc-noteref"><sup>541</sup></a></strong>. It also
announces Isaiah 65 saying <strong>"For, behold, I create new heavens
and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into
mind” <a href="#fn542" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref542"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>542</sup></a></strong>. And Revelation 21
saying: <strong>“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first
heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea”
<a href="#fn543" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref543"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>543</sup></a></strong>. And in Zephaniah 1 also
announces saying: <strong>“I will utterly sweep away
<strong>EVERYTHING</strong> from the surface of the earth, says Yahweh.
I will sweep away man and animal. I will sweep away the birds of the
sky, the fish of the sea, and the heaps of rubble with the wicked. I
will cut off man from the surface of the earth, says Yahweh” <a
href="#fn544" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref544"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>544</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>This is the time when Adam's offspring ends. No more children of
children of children of Adam. Finale, end, no more.</p>
<p>From this moment on, the new earth with the new heavens, that Kingdom
of Heaven, that Kingdom of God, which Jehovah began to build spiritually
since Jesus Christ began to announce the Kingdom of Heavens, it starts
to be a new PHYSICAL earth and a new PHYSICAL heavens too. A Kingdom of
Heaven also PHYSICAL here on this planet. A kingdom of God in whom the
Lord will dwell among men forever and ever.</p>
<p>Paul explains in 1 Corinthians 15 quoting Hosea 13 saying <strong>"O
death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?” <a
href="#fn545" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref545"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>545</sup></a></strong>. And in Isaiah 25 this
moment is announced saying <strong>“He has swallowed up death forever!
The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will take
the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh has
spoken it” <a href="#fn546" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref546"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>546</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>It is at the end of those thousand years that happens the physical
resurrection of the dead, of ALL dead people, with the exception of
144,000 who were already resurrected. It is after those thousand years
when they ALL will be resurrected, even the ones that have just been
destroyed by the physical fire that destroyed the previous physical
heavens and earth. That's what it says Revelation 20: <strong>“WHEN THE
THOUSAND YEARS <strong>HAVE</strong> <strong>EXPIRED</strong>” <a
href="#fn547" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref547"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>547</sup></a></strong>. It's AFTER those
thousand years when it happens the announcement of Jesus Christ that
says: <strong>“Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which
all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth those who
have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done
evil, to the resurrection of” <a href="#fn548" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref548" role="doc-noteref"><sup>548</sup></a> “judgment” <a
href="#fn549" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref549"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>549</sup></a></strong>. And John describes it in
Revelation 20 saying: <strong>“The sea gave up the dead who were in it,
and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they
were judged, each one according to his works” <a href="#fn550"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref550"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>550</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<h4 id="section"><span id="anchor-161"></span>144,000</h4>
<p>The firstfruits in Christ are first in the Spirit and then also
physically when they are resurrected. All born again, all born in the
Spirit, are spiritual firstfruits in Christ, but they have not risen
physically yet.</p>
<p>When Matthew 27 speaks to us of the death of Jesus Christ, he also
speaks to us of some physical first fruits, he says: <strong>“And the
graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, And
came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy
city, and appeared unto many” <a href="#fn551" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref551" role="doc-noteref"><sup>551</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ tells us about these FEW when speaking to the Israelites
tells them in Matthew 7 that: <strong>“Because strait is the gate, and
narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and FEW there be that find
it" <a href="#fn552" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref552"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>552</sup></a></strong>, or in Matthew 20 when it
says that: <strong>“for many be called, but <strong>FEW</strong> chosen”
<a href="#fn553" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref553"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>553</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In Revelation 14 we are told of these 144,000 that: <strong>“These
are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These
are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by
Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb. In their
mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless” <a href="#fn554"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref554"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>554</sup></a></strong>. And in Revelation 7 says
that they are “of ALL the tribes of the children of Israel” <a
href="#fn555" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref555"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>555</sup></a>. They are only Israelite males,
twelve thousand from each tribe. Listen: Only from EACH tribe of the
CHILDREN of ISRAEL <a href="#fn556" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref556"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>556</sup></a>. And speaking in past tense, and
prophetically towards the future, it says that they will not have
relations with women and will never lie.</p>
<p>From what Jesus Christ tells us in Luke 13 <a href="#fn557"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref557"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>557</sup></a>, it follows that between these
will be Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the prophets. It is possible that
we can also count David among these FEW, if the old testament prophecies
are going to be fulfilled literally. And judging by the archaeological
evidence in Jerusalem, it can be believed that David’s tomb is empty. So
it’s possibly that David was one of those who people saw walking through
Jerusalem after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, according to Matthew
27. Only that when our Lord returns, the resurrected David will have
zero sex. Virgin. Zero wives.</p>
<p>The apostles are also among the 144,000. According to Matthew 28
<strong>“Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have
followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the
throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the
twelve tribes of Israel” <a href="#fn558" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref558" role="doc-noteref"><sup>558</sup></a></strong>. And it is
very possible that they are already resurrected and with Jesus Christ in
these heavens. Those ones that have clouds, that can be seen, and in
Adam's time had waters below and waters above.</p>
<p>Thus, many of these 144,000 are already resurrected and reigning with
Jesus Christ from today’s heavens, and right now it’s happening what
John prophesied in Revelation 6, that: <strong>“They cried with a loud
voice, saying, How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and
avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?” <a href="#fn559"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref559"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>559</sup></a></strong>. But they have not yet
been sealed because they are not yet complete. And as some forget what
the scriptures say, you have to remind them that only the alive, those
who have a body and a mouth to speak, can cry out, can think, or praise.
And to be in today’s heavens and be able to claim one needs to be
resurrected, in body and Spirit. The rest are with their body made dust
and with their spirit completely asleep.</p>
<p>These 144,000 are the same ones mentioned in Revelation 20 when John
says that: <strong>“And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and
judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were
beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which
had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received
his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and
reigned with Christ a thousand years” <a href="#fn560"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref560"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>560</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>The rest of those who BEGIN the thousand years, according to
Revelation 7, are a countless crowd, a multitude. A multitude over which
the 144,000 reign, multitude which John describes in Revelation 7 as
<strong>“These are the ones who come out of the great tribulation” <a
href="#fn561" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref561"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>561</sup></a></strong>. And that they are
<strong>“a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations,
tribes, peoples, and tongues" <a href="#fn562" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref562" role="doc-noteref"><sup>562</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>But only those 144,000 are resurrected, the rest are not. The rest
will die physically as everyone does. And this rest of those who BEGIN
the thousand years, that great multitude of Revelation 7, only includes
those <strong>"who come <strong>OUT</strong> of the great tribulation”
<a href="#fn563" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref563"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>563</sup></a></strong>. Listen: come “OUT” of
the great tribulation, that is what the word G1537 indicates. That great
multitude does not include any person who has died physically. All the
great multitude was alive physically when that "great tribulation"
started, from which, according to Revelation 7, they "come out". Only
that after finishing that great tribulation they will live a little
longer than those who died before, or during, that great tribulation. As
Isaiah 65 says, a person who dies at the age of 100 is considered a
child, and people will live like the days of the trees <a href="#fn564"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref564"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>564</sup></a>.</p>
<p>All 144,000 are sealed, appointed, chosen, BEFORE the trumpets of the
book of Revelation. At this time, ALL of the physically resurrected are
part of the 144,000. But NOT ALL 144,000 have died physically when the
trumpets begin. That is to say that when the trumpets begin, NOT ALL of
the 144,000 will have risen, most of them, but not all. Some are killed
and resurrected DURING the first 6 trumpets.</p>
<p>This is why Revelation 20 describes some of the 144,000 as those who
<strong>“had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had
received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands” <a
href="#fn565" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref565"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>565</sup></a></strong>. ALL 144,00 are finally
physically resurrected at the END of the sixth trumpet but BEFORE the
bowls. This is what Revelation 14 <a href="#fn566" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref566" role="doc-noteref"><sup>566</sup></a> talks about. In
Revelation 7 they are marked, sealed and in Revelation 14 they are ALL
resurrected. These are the Saints mentioned in Revelation 13 when it
says that to the first beast <strong>"was given unto him to make war
with the saints, and to overcome them” <a href="#fn567"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref567"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>567</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>And let's remember that those 144,000 do not include women. There are
no women resurrected in the thousand years that Jesus Christ reigns
along with those 144,000, those FEW. The ones who are there, they are
all among the great multitude that is normally dying. There are no
virgin women resurrected and therefore no woman, virgin or not, who has
died, can PRAY for us mortals. Every woman who has physically died has
her body made dust and her spirit well ASLEEP. Only until the thousand
years have EXPIRED, they will be resurrected with the rest of
humanity.</p>
<p>Asking a woman who has physically died to PRAY for someone to the
heavenly Father or to his Son Jesus Christ is simply invoking the dead.
There are NO women resurrected until the resurrection of ALL dead
occurs, after the thousand years. If someone asks a woman who has died
to please “PRAY for us sinners now, and at the hour of death”, he is
just invoking a DEAD person and, according to the old testament, it is a
sin punishable by physical death.</p>
<p>Many people believe that just by following Jesus Christ, or being
born again in the Spirit, or by dying for Jesus Christ, that they are on
the list of those who will reign with Jesus Christ for a thousand years.
It may be because they like to reign. But first you have to reign over
Satan, sin and the world. First you have to put Satan at your feet. And
that it’s only done by the Holy Spirit. And it’s a process. First you
have to go through the ETERNAL FIRE. To those believers I recommend
reading again the characteristics of those who are on the list that will
reign with Jesus Christ.</p>
<h4 id="gods-wrath_DOT_"><span id="anchor-162"></span>God's Wrath.</h4>
<p>There are only two ways to understand the processes of the book of
Revelation called “seals”, “trumpets” and “bowls”: spiritually or
physically. And by now it should be clear that to your host, me, Jose
Luis Quiroga, it WAS the heavenly Father, the Holy Spirit and Life
itself, who have him led to understand what the bible says as it’s
written, for as hard as it may be to believe it. So this is not the
exception: the processes described in the “seals”, the “trumpets” and
the “cups”, as dramatic and catastrophic as they may seem, are just as
they are described in the book.</p>
<p>When Revelation 8 says that: <strong>“the third part of trees was
burnt up, and ALL green grass was burnt up” <a href="#fn568"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref568"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>568</sup></a></strong>, what it means is exactly
that: that a third part of trees was burned and that ALL green grass was
also burned.</p>
<p>When it says that: <strong>"the third part of the creatures which
were in the sea, and had life, died” <a href="#fn569"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref569"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>569</sup></a></strong>, what it means is just
that: that a third of what lived in the sea died.</p>
<p>And when it says that the Sun and the Moon: <strong>"the third part
of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and
the night likewise” <a href="#fn570" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref570"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>570</sup></a></strong>, guess what? That’s what
it MEANS.</p>
<p>The same thing happens when Revelation 9 says that for 5 months
<strong>“shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire
to die, and death shall flee from them” <a href="#fn571"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref571"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>571</sup></a></strong>, or when it says that: by
plagues <strong>“was the third part of men killed” <a href="#fn572"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref572"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>572</sup></a></strong>, or when it says that
those who remained alive: <strong>“Neither repented they of their
murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their
thefts” <a href="#fn573" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref573"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>573</sup></a></strong>. The interpretation is
direct. There is nothing to interpret.</p>
<p>And that's just on the trumpets. Then come the bowls.</p>
<p>In Revelation 16 it says that the sea <strong>“became as the blood of
a dead man: and EVERY living soul DIED in the sea” <a href="#fn574"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref574"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>574</sup></a></strong>. It also says that
<strong>"the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood” <a
href="#fn575" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref575"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>575</sup></a></strong>. And that after this, 3
evil spirits went <strong>"working miracles, which go forth unto the
kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle
of that great day of God Almighty” <a href="#fn576" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref576" role="doc-noteref"><sup>576</sup></a></strong>. Another
world war between 3 great powers.</p>
<p>But the thing doesn’t end there, because later it says that
<strong>"there was a great earthquake, such as was NOT SINCE men were
upon the earth” <a href="#fn577" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref577"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>577</sup></a></strong> and that <strong>“the
cities of the nations collapsed” <a href="#fn578" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref578" role="doc-noteref"><sup>578</sup></a></strong> and that
<strong>“<strong>EVERY</strong> island fled away, and the mountains were
not found” <a href="#fn579" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref579"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>579</sup></a></strong>. An earthquake like it
has NEVER been since men have been upon the earth, in which the cities
of the world COLLAPSE.</p>
<p>But it doesn't end there either. After that <strong>“there fell upon
men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a
talent” <a href="#fn580" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref580"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>580</sup></a></strong>. And in this case the
interpretation may be somewhat different because the greek word is
“talantiaios” that translates talent, and in John's time there were
several kinds of talent. It is possible that it refers to different
values between 32 kilograms or 59 kilograms. But let's say more than 32
kilograms. A hail like bowling balls, which also have different values
of weight.</p>
<p>Revelation 16 also says that those who survived the hailstorm, which
won't be many, because if a bowling ball falls on someone, the thing
seems deadly, say a few thousand people, what did they do? They
BLASPHEMED against God <a href="#fn581" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref581" role="doc-noteref"><sup>581</sup></a>. But, says
Revelation 19, that all of those survivors <strong>“were slain with the
sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his
mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh” <a href="#fn582"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref582"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>582</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation teaches us that the final process before
beginning the thousand years of peace consists of 7 “seals”, where the
7th seal corresponds to a process that is divided into 7 “trumpets”, and
the 7th trumpet corresponds to a process that is divided into 7 “bowls”.
The bible also teaches us that the 7 trumpets, that is, the first 6
trumpets and all the “bowls” correspond to a process called "God's
wrath”. The wrath of God corresponds to the “trumpets” and the
“bowls”.</p>
<p>Of those who begin to receive the wrath, in the end, after the wrath,
after the “trumpets” and the “bowls”, NO ONE, none, are left physically
alive. EVERYONE dies physically, one way or another. And I insist in a
physical death, because let’s remember that before the wrath started
they were already spiritually dead. Some people, after the beginning of
the wrath, are born spiritually, but they are physically killed, just
for being born in the spirit. They kill them before starting the
"bowls", the final part of wrath, the seventh trumpet. Of those born
again, who are killed, says Revelation 14 that <strong>"Blessed are the
dead which die in the Lord from henceforth” <a href="#fn583"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref583"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>583</sup></a></strong>. And of those blessed
ones who die during the first 6 trumpets by cause of following Jesus
Christ, even more blessed are those jewish men who die with their
throats cut, because they are part of the 144,000 who were already
sealed since The Wrath of God began.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this great suffering and death, just before the
beginning of the seventh seal, that is, before all the trumpets and all
the bowls, says Revelation 6 that: <strong>“the kings of the earth, and
the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty
men, and every bondman, and every free man” <strong>and </strong>“said
to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him
that sitteth on the throne, and from the <strong>WRATH</strong> of the
Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to
stand?” <a href="#fn584" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref584"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>584</sup></a></strong>. The wrath of the Lamb.
The trumpets and the bowls are that wrath of God.</p>
<p>And for this host it is logically inconsistent, incoherent,
incongruous to believe that while all these dramatic things are
happening people would be <strong>“eating and drinking, marrying and
giving in marriage” <a href="#fn585" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref585"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>585</sup></a></strong>, as says our Lord Jesus
Christ, according to Matthew 24, that it will be at the time He comes
back. Or that people, they <strong>“eat, they drank, they bought, they
sold, they planted, they builded” <a href="#fn586" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref586" role="doc-noteref"><sup>586</sup></a></strong>, as Jesus
Christ says, according to Luke 17.</p>
<p>When there is no water to drink, when everything in the sea is dead,
and there is no good light neither in the day nor in the night, and
there is another world war, people will not be thinking of getting
married or planting or building or drinking. People will be thinking
about how to survive, and according to what the same book tells us:
<strong>"Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries,
nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts” <a href="#fn587"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref587"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>587</sup></a></strong>. Oh, and with exception
of the few people who die believing in Jesus Christ during the first 6
trumpets, ALL those who are left alive after each plague, physically
alive because spiritually they are dead, they will also blaspheme
against God.</p>
<p>It is also very hard to believe that all the "trumpets" and "bowls"
take place <strong>"as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth
even unto the west” <a href="#fn588" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref588"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>588</sup></a></strong>, as Jesus Christ tells us
that it will be when He returns, according to Matthew 24. Those
“trumpets” and those “bowls” take quite some time. Something has already
happened before the Wrath of God.</p>
<h4 id="caught-up_DOT_"><span id="anchor-163"></span>Caught up.</h4>
<p>Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 4 that: those who are alive, when Jesus
Christ returns, <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>s</strong>hall be
caught up together with them in the clouds, <strong>TO</strong>
<strong>MEET</strong> the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with
the Lord<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn589" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref589" role="doc-noteref"><sup>589</sup></a></strong></strong>.
In this verse the Strong code behind the “TO MEET” is G529 that,
according to biblehub, is also used as “TO RECEIVE” in a reception, that
is, as to return later with Jesus Christ once the reception is over.</p>
<p>Paul also says in Romans 5 about us believers in Jesus Christ that
<strong>"now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from
<strong>WRATH</strong> through him” <a href="#fn590"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref590"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>590</sup></a></strong>. And in 1 Thessalonians 5
it says, <strong>"For God hath <strong>NOT</strong> appointed us to
<strong>WRATH</strong>, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
Christ” <a href="#fn591" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref591"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>591</sup></a></strong>. And in 1 Thessalonians 1
it says: <strong>“And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised
from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the
<strong>WRATH</strong> to come” <a href="#fn592" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref592" role="doc-noteref"><sup>592</sup></a></strong>. Of the
WRATH that is to come. When? Well, just when Jesus comes back, that's
why he talks about waiting for his Son. That is why in Romans 2 it tells
us about <strong>"the day of <strong>WRATH</strong> and revelation of
the righteous judgment of God” <a href="#fn593" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref593" role="doc-noteref"><sup>593</sup></a></strong>. Day that
doesn't last long <strong>“For his <strong>ANGER</strong> is but for a
<strong>MOMENT</strong>. His favor is for a <strong>LIFETIME</strong>”
<a href="#fn594" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref594"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>594</sup></a></strong>, that says Psalm 30. A
little over 3 and a half years of wrath. Say about 4 to 6 years of
wrath. While his favor lasts for a lifetime, and let us remember that
life in Christ Jesus is ETERNAL.</p>
<p>Thus, while those who have been caught up are receiving Jesus Christ
the rest are under the wrath of God. Receiving trumpets and bowls.</p>
<p>Those chosen by Jesus Christ are raptured or taken as it says in
Matthew 24: <strong><strong>“two men will be in the field: one will be
taken and one will be left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one
will be taken and one will be left. Watch therefore, for you don’t know
in what hour your Lord comes” </strong><strong><a href="#fn595"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref595"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>595</sup></a></strong></strong>. Or in Luke 17
when he says, <strong><strong>"in that night there will be two people in
one bed. One will be taken and the other will be left”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn596" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref596"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>596</sup></a></strong></strong>. And this will
happen <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>a</strong>s the lightning
flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will the coming
of the Son of Man be<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn597"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref597"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>597</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Like this will be the day of his return. A day that lasts a thousand
years because Peter explains that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>o</strong>ne day is with the Lord as a
thousand years, and a thousand years as one day<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn598" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref598"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>598</sup></a></strong></strong>. And those who
live that day will always be before the Lord, because Jesus Christ will
be reigning, from the temple described in Ezekiel, which will be built
in Israel, with the help of 144,000 sealed ones, over a multitude that
cannot be counted, those who were caught up, those who came out from the
great tribulation, escaping from The God's Wrath. A thousand years that
come AFTER the trumpets and the bowls.</p>
<p>The taken or raptured, together with the 144,000, will be the first
to physically begin to fulfill the biblical promises that the righteous
will inherit the earth.</p>
<p>The taken or raptured are that great multitude described by
Revelation 7 as <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>T</strong>hese are
they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes,
and made them white in the blood of the Lamb<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn599" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref599"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>599</sup></a></strong></strong>. And that They
are <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>a</strong><strong> great
multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and
people, and tongues” </strong><strong><a href="#fn600"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref600"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>600</sup></a></strong></strong>. Description
made in Revelation 7 just before the 7th seal. He says of this multitude
that: They <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>stood before the throne,
and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;
And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth
upon the throne, and unto the Lamb” </strong><strong><a href="#fn601"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref601"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>601</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In this context it is very easy to understand the words of Jesus
Christ in his parables of Matthew 25 when it says that the kingdom of
heaven will be like 10 virgins in which 5 wise enter the wedding and
others do not <a href="#fn602" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref602"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>602</sup></a>, or the parable in which he says
that <strong>“when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy
angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. Before him
all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from
another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats”</strong> and
to some he will say <strong>“Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the
Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world”</strong> and
to the others he will say <strong>“Depart from me, you cursed, into the
eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels” <a
href="#fn603" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref603"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>603</sup></a></strong>. And so it will be
fulfilled the first part of the physical manifestation of the Kingdom of
Heaven on Earth, and the words of Jesus Christ when he says that:
<strong>"Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in
heaven. Many will tell me in that day, Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in
your name, in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty
works? Then I will tell them, I never knew you. Depart from me, you who
work iniquit<strong>y</strong>” <a href="#fn604" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref604" role="doc-noteref"><sup>604</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>The ones who enter the wedding are those taken or raptured to RECEIVE
Jesus Christ and then RETURN later with him. The rest are left out of
the wedding. And in Matthew 22 an additional detail is given to us when
in another parable of a wedding he tells us that: <strong>"when the king
came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn't have on
<strong>WEDDING</strong> clothing, and he said to him, Friend, how did
you come in here not wearing <strong>WEDDING</strong> clothing? He was
speechless. Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,
take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness. That is where the
weeping and grinding of teeth will be” <a href="#fn605"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref605"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>605</sup></a></strong>. Even after having
entered the wedding the king can return someone if he is not in wedding
clothing. If you haven't washed your clothes and have made them white
with the blood of the Lamb, according to Revelation 7. They are a
minority because of all those who were at the wedding, of that great
crowd, only one was returned back, but it can happen.</p>
<p>This wedding is the same one that Revelation 19 tells us about when
it says: <strong>“Let's rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let's give
the glory to him. For the <strong>WEDDING</strong> of the Lamb has come,
and his wife has made herself ready. It was given to her that she would
array herself in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the
righteous acts of the saints. He said to me, Write, Blessed are those
who are invited to the <strong>WEDDING</strong> supper of the Lamb. He
said to me, These are true words of God” <a href="#fn606"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref606"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>606</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<h4 id="great-tribulation_DOT_"><span id="anchor-164"></span>Great
Tribulation.</h4>
<p>Jesus Christ warns his followers that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong>n the world you have
trouble; but cheer up! I have overcome the world<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn607" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref607"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>607</sup></a></strong></strong>. And that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>ou will be hated by
all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn608" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref608"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>608</sup></a></strong></strong>. And that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>hey will
</strong><strong>put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that
whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn609" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref609"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>609</sup></a></strong></strong>. And that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>Y</strong><strong>ou will be handed
over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause
some of you to be put to death” </strong><strong><a href="#fn610"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref610"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>610</sup></a></strong></strong>. And that:
<strong><strong>"Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the
father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them
to be put to death" </strong><strong><a href="#fn611"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref611"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>611</sup></a></strong></strong>. And that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong><strong>f the world hates
you, you know that it has hated me before it hated
yo</strong><strong>u</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn612"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref612"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>612</sup></a></strong></strong>. And that:
<strong><strong>“A servant is not greater than his lord. If they
persecuted me, they will also persecute you” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn613" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref613"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>613</sup></a></strong></strong>. And that
<strong><strong>“Then they will deliver you up to oppression and will
kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name’s sake”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn614" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref614"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>614</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>And in particular for the moment when he is about to return, in
Matthew 24, Jesus Christ tells us that: <strong>“for then there will be
great suffering, such as has not been from the beginning of the world
until now, no, nor ever will be” <a href="#fn615" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref615" role="doc-noteref"><sup>615</sup></a></strong>. Jesus
Christ tells us the same thing in Mark 13: <strong>“For in those days
there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the
beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will
be” <a href="#fn616" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref616"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>616</sup></a></strong>. Which has NOT been since
creation and will NEVER be later.</p>
<p>And Jesus Christ adds that: <strong>“Unless those days had been
shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the
chosen ones, those days will be shortened” <a href="#fn617"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref617"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>617</sup></a></strong>. They are shortened by
and for the chosen, the ones taken, or caught up, because for the rest
they are not shortened. The rest will all suffer the Wrath of God and
die physically because let’s remember that spiritually they were ALREADY
dead. They will NOT physically live again until the moment of the
resurrection of the dead, a thousand years later.</p>
<p>The chosen start the great tribulation but do not suffer the most
dramatic part, the one in which no one survives, the so-called Wrath of
God. The chosen only live the tribulation, that is, the beginning of the
great tribulation.</p>
<p>The tribulation only includes the first 6 “seals”, and these are
suffered by the whole planet. The great tribulation also includes the
7th seal. 7th seal that, let us remember, corresponds to the trumpets
and bowls, the Wrath of God.</p>
<p>In Revelation 6, John tells us about a horseman <strong><strong>“and
power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth,
and that they should kill one another” </strong><strong><a href="#fn618"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref618"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>618</sup></a></strong></strong>. And about
another horseman to whom
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>a</strong>uthority over one fourth of
the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the
wild animals of the earth was given to him<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn619" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref619"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>619</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Which corresponds to the description made by Jesus Christ according
to Matthew 24 on the events prior to his arrival:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>F</strong>or nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and
pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn620" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref620"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>620</sup></a></strong></strong> and that He
calls <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>he beginning
of sorrows” </strong><strong><a href="#fn621" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref621" role="doc-noteref"><sup>621</sup></a></strong></strong>.
which also it is narrated in Mark 13 <a href="#fn622"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref622"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>622</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In other words: nothing that hasn't been seen since Jesus Christ was
resurrected, just that more often. Just as with labor pains, these pains
get more frequent as the moment of his coming gets closer.</p>
<p>According to Revelation 6, when the Lamb opened the 6th seal
<strong>"there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth
made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood. The stars of the sky
fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is
shaken by a great wind. The sky was removed like a scroll when it is
rolled up. Every mountain and island was moved out of its place” <a
href="#fn623" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref623"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>623</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Which corresponds to what was described by Jesus Christ in Matthew 24
after that “beginning of sorrows”:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>s</strong>hall the sun be darkened,
and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from
heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be
shake<strong>n</strong><strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn624"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref624"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>624</sup></a></strong></strong>. Or with what is
described in Mark 13: <strong><strong>“the sun shall be darkened, and
the moon shall not give her light, And the stars of heaven shall fall,
and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn625" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref625"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>625</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>It does not seem very easy to fulfill that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong>he stars of heaven fell unto
the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is
shaken of a mighty wind<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn626"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref626"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>626</sup></a></strong></strong>, but no one can
ask for a clearer and more graphic description. This description
corresponds with the one given by Isaiah 34 for the moment of the
beginning of the Wrath of God:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>nd all the host of
heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a
scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from
the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn627" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref627"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>627</sup></a></strong></strong>. The hebrew
word, which in this case is correctly translated as “hosts”, is the word
tzabaot, with the Strong code H6635. This hebrew word when referring to
the heavens can refer to the stars or to everything in the heavens
including the birds, but the correct interpretation in this context is
to understand it as the armies of angels that are in heaven. What falls
as the leaf falls of the vine or the figs of the fig tree are angels.
Armies of them. Just as Jesus Christ continues describing that moment in
Matthew 24: <strong><strong>“they will see the Son of Man coming on the
clouds of the sky with power and great glory. He will send out his
angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together
his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the
other” </strong><strong><a href="#fn628" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref628"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>628</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>This is the moment that happens like lightning, the moment when some
are caught up, or taken, and others are not. The moment that no one
knows the day or the hour, but only the heavenly Father. Careful,
neither the day nor the hour. This moment comes as in the time of Noah,
or as in the time of Lot: in an INSTANT. And although neither the day
nor the hour is known, the year has to be very close.</p>
<p>The good news for those who ARE raptured, according to Jesus Christ
in Luke 17, is that, despite the moments of great tribulation,
tribulation bigger than it has ever been and will never be, they have
already begun, by the time believers are caught up, people still did
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>e</strong>at, they drank, they bought,
they sold, they planted, they builded<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn629" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref629"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>629</sup></a></strong></strong>. That is, until
the believers are raptured, life goes on more or less as it has been
since Jesus Christ was resurrected. Good news for the raptured.</p>
<p>The bad news for those who are NOT raptured is that, by the time the
Great Tribulation ends, everyone dies. Not a single one is left alive.
And since those are precisely the ones who did NOT believe in the
resurrection of Jesus Christ, but that death is the end, well for them,
they are very bad news. It's bad news because they think it's the end.
The truth is that they have to wait until the resurrection of the dead
to realize that what they believed was false. Which in reality are good
news if they could believe them. Bad news for those who are NOT
raptured.</p>
<h4 id="eternal-abhorrence_DOT_"><span id="anchor-165"></span>Eternal
Abhorrence.</h4>
<p>The book of Daniel in chapter 12 tells us that:
<strong><strong>"</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>he multitude of
those sleeping in the dust of the ground do awake"</strong></strong>
<strong><strong><a href="#fn630" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref630"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>630</sup></a></strong></strong>, regarding this
text it is important to note that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is located at a moment in which there will be
<strong><strong>"</strong><strong>a</strong> time of trouble, such as
never was since there was a nation even to that same
time<strong>"</strong></strong> <a href="#fn631" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref631" role="doc-noteref"><sup>631</sup></a> that corresponds to
the moment that Jesus Christ calls "Great Tribulation", the same name
used in this presentation, because it uses the same description used by
our Lord Jesus Christ to refer to said moment.</li>
<li>In hebrew, the word translated as "multitude", the word H7227 also
has the meaning "great" or "important".</li>
<li>It delimits us which are those "great" ones who are "awakened". It
says that: <strong><strong>"</strong><strong>a</strong>t that time thy
people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the
book<strong>"</strong></strong> <a href="#fn632" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref632" role="doc-noteref"><sup>632</sup></a>, that is, all the
descendants of Israel who are written in the book at that time. If you
are not a descendant of Israel you are not in the group, and if it is
not written in the book at that time, you are not in the group
either.</li>
<li>The hebrew of the text indicates that the following four phrases
ALWAYS refer to these SAME people, to these “great” ones who get
“awaken”. There is no division as most translations suggest.</li>
<li>The phrases: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong>o life
age-during<strong>”</strong></strong>,
<strong><strong>“</strong></strong><span
id="anchor-166"></span><strong><strong>to reproaches -- to abhorrence
age-during”</strong></strong>,
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>hose teaching do
shine as the brightness of the expanse”</strong></strong> and
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>hose justifying the
multitude as stars”</strong></strong> <a href="#fn633"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref633" role="doc-noteref"><sup>633</sup></a>
ALWAYS refer to the SAME group of people. Those who were written in the
book. Those "great" ones who were "awakened".</li>
<li>There are only two occurrences in the entire TANAKH, in the entire
Old Testament, of the word "deraon", the word H1860, translated in some
versions as "horror". One in Isaiah 66, which we already analyzed, and
this one. There are no more. This makes it difficult to identify the
original hebrew meaning of the word because there are only two possible
contexts from which to deduce that meaning.</li>
</ol>
<p>Accepting the translation of "abhorrence" for the word H1860, the
same one that was accepted when analyzing the word "Ge-Henna", the word
G1067, and taking into account these observations, it is easy to see
that this group of people from Daniel 12 are the 144,000 Saints that
have already been analyzed as well. The only ones who have been
resurrected up to that moment. And that "abhorrence" and those
"reproaches" are the same ones described in Isaiah 66 that ALL FLESH
will feel on the FINAL day when the resurrection of ALL the dead takes
place.</p>
<h4 id="the-abomination-of-desolation_DOT_"><span id="anchor-167"></span>The
Abomination of Desolation.</h4>
<p>According to Matthew 24, Jesus Christ explains that the beginning of
the Great Tribulation is marked by the time <strong>"When, therefore,
you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through
Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader
understand)” <a href="#fn634" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref634"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>634</sup></a></strong>. And very similar words
according to Mark 13 <strong>“when you see the abomination of
desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not
(let the reader understand)” <a href="#fn635" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref635" role="doc-noteref"><sup>635</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>There are only two verses in the entire new testament that mention
the prophet Daniel. They are these two and both are in the mouth of our
Lord Jesus Christ announcing the beginning of a
<strong><strong>“</strong>great tribulation, such as was not since the
beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn636" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref636"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>636</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>The greek word behind the word “to see”, the word G3708, horaó, it’s
also used in the sense of understanding, discerning, recognizing. That
is why at the end of both texts he also emphasizes "let the reader
understand".</p>
<p>To see, understand, discern and recognize, let us first see,
understand and recognize what Daniel spoke of.</p>
<p>The phrase "Abomination of Desolation" refers to the sequence of
hebrew words “shiqquts” and “shamem”, the words H8251 <a href="#fn637"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref637" role="doc-noteref"><sup>637</sup></a>
and H8074 <a href="#fn638" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref638"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>638</sup></a>. This sequence only appears in 3
verses in the entire tanakh: in Daniel 9 <a href="#fn639"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref639"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>639</sup></a>, in Daniel 11 <a href="#fn640"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref640" role="doc-noteref"><sup>640</sup></a>
and in Daniel 12 <a href="#fn641" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref641"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>641</sup></a>.</p>
<h5 id="the-final-moment_DOT_"><span id="anchor-168"></span>The final
moment.</h5>
<p>The 1st to understand of the 3 mentions in the Tanakh of the sequence
“Abomination of Desolation” is the one in Daniel 12. This allows us to
see, understand, discern and recognize what time it is. It happens in
Daniel 12 when the angel says to Daniel: <strong>“Go your way, Daniel;
for the words are shut up and sealed until the time of the end. Many
will purify themselves, and make themselves white, and be refined; but
the wicked will do wickedly; and none of the wicked will understand; but
those who are wise will understand. From the time that the continual
burnt offering is taken away, and the <strong>ABOMINATION </strong>that
makes <strong>DESOLATE</strong> set up, there will be one thousand two
hundred ninety days. Blessed is he who waits, and comes to the one
thousand three hundred thirty-five days” <a href="#fn642"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref642"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>642</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>So let's begin to open and unseal these words because it is the time
of the end.</p>
<p>It is completely undeniable that if the principle of prophetic
interpretation called "a year for every day", the prophecies in Daniel 9
corresponds perfectly with Jesus Christ as the Meshiakh of Israel and
the temple of Jehovah in Jerusalem. It predicts the moment of beginning
of the reconstruction of the temple, the moment of the beginning of the
ministry of Jesus Christ, the time of the death of Jesus Christ, and the
time of the destruction of the temple by the Romans. So it's not
preposterous to think that it is at least possible to apply the
principle with other prophecies in Daniel. Which is precisely what makes
it possible to discern Daniel 12 in regards to the "Abomination of
Desolation".</p>
<p>The first thing to determine is the date on which the daily sacrifice
was suspended. There are several possibilities for this date but the
fundamental argument to this explanation is that the particular way in
which we see the hebrew word “sur” written, the code H5493, which is
translated as “TAKEN AWAY” in the text
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>f</strong>rom the time that the
continual burnt offering is<strong> TAKEN AWAY” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn643" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref643"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>643</sup></a></strong></strong>, only appears in
two verses of the tanakh: in Daniel 12 and in Leviticus 4 when he says:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>ll its fat he shall
take away, like the fat is taken away from the sacrifice of peace
offerings” </strong><strong><a href="#fn644" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref644" role="doc-noteref"><sup>644</sup></a></strong></strong>,
and the Leviticus occurrence is referring to the fat that was TAKEN AWAY
or removed during the peace offering.</p>
<p>Understanding in this way the "TAKEN AWAY" when Daniel 12 tells us
that: <strong>“<strong>f</strong>rom the time that the continual burnt
offering is TAKEN AWAY” <a href="#fn645" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref645" role="doc-noteref"><sup>645</sup></a></strong>, there are
only two reasonable possibilities, from Daniel's point of view, in which
the continual sacrifice was taken away:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The moment narrated in 2nd Kings 24 when Nebuchadnezzar went up
against Jerusalem in the time of King Jehoiachin aged 18 and
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>H</strong>e carried out from there all
the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house,
and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold, which Solomon king of Israel
had made in Yahweh’s temple”<strong> </strong><strong><a href="#fn646"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref646"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>646</sup></a></strong></strong>, or</li>
<li>The moment narrated in 2nd Kings 25 when Nebuchadnezzar takes
Jerusalem and <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>H</strong>e burned
Yahweh’s house, the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, even
every great house, he burned with fire<strong>” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn647" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref647"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>647</sup></a></strong></strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to historical evidence, the first moment happened in 598 or
597 before Jesus Christ and the second moment happened in 587 or 586
before Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>If each day is a year in Daniel 12, the "Abomination of Desolation"
corresponds to what happened 1290 years later in the place of the Holy
of Holies.</p>
<p>Regarding the first option, the completion of the golden Dome of the
Rock, between 691 and 692 after Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>And regarding the second option, the completion of the Al-Aqsa Mosque
between 702 and 703 after Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Both located on top of Jehovah's Holy Mountain, Mount Moriah, above
where Solomon's temple was built.</p>
<p>As an observation for people who like to add: you have to take into
account that there is no year zero. From 1 before Jesus Christ the
system goes to 1 after Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The "Abomination of Desolation" is the temples complex of Muhammad
above the Holy place. These are the objects that represent the most
false prophet in the entire history of mankind, Muhammad, above the Holy
place, of the Holy mount, of mount Moriah, of the one True God, of the
Creator of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>And if you had not seen it that way, you have already begun to see it
and the words of Jesus Christ have began to be fulfilled: “when you see”
and “let the reader understand”.</p>
<p>Thus, by the time the majority of the body of Jesus Christ, of the
congregation of the born again, see, understand, discern and recognize
the "Abomination of Desolation", by the time that happens, the Great
Tribulation, that period of time of suffering like never before and
there will never be, it will have already begun.</p>
<p>And according to Daniel 12 <a href="#fn648" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref648" role="doc-noteref"><sup>648</sup></a>, blessed are those
who manage to wait for the 1335 years since that mosque is in the Holy
place. For the first option that year is between 2026 and 2027 and for
the second option it is between 2037 and 2038.</p>
<p>This host, Jose Luis Quiroga, believes any of the great pending
events regarding the return of Jesus Christ will happen at that moment
of "blessed". Even the one that simply fulfills the words of Jesus
Christ: <strong>“when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of
by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader
understand)” <a href="#fn649" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref649"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>649</sup></a></strong>, indicating the beginning
of the Great Tribulation.</p>
<h5 id="weeks_DOT_"><span id="anchor-169"></span>70 Weeks.</h5>
<p>The 2nd to understand of the 3 mentions in the Tanakh of the sequence
"Abomination of Desolation" is that of Daniel 9. This occurrence of the
sequence of hebrew words “shiqquts” and “shamem”, the words H8251 <a
href="#fn650" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref650"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>650</sup></a> and H8074 <a href="#fn651"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref651"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>651</sup></a>, commonly translated as
“Abomination of Desolation” is just after the end of the 70 weeks
prophecy in Daniel 9. The 70-week prophecy ends in the middle of the
verse 27 <a href="#fn652" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref652"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>652</sup></a>.</p>
<p>It is a very common construction in hebrew to put a “vev” character
before to the word “al”, the word H5921, to indicate “and after”, or
“and on”, or “and above”, as a grammatical continuation that may also
indicate a temporal continuation. And that continuation can happen even
600 years later.</p>
<p>Thus, the description of the 70 weeks ends with the word "minkha",
the word H4503, which means gift or offering, and refers to the death of
Jesus Christ in the middle of the last week.</p>
<p>This last week ends with the appearance of Jesus Christ to Shaul,
commonly known as Paul, on his way to Damascus <a href="#fn653"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref653"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>653</sup></a>, just 7 years after Jesus Christ
was baptized by John the Baptist, event that marked the beginning of
this last week. It is with this last act that Jesus Christ brings “in
everlasting righteousness”, and “seals up the vision and prophecy”, thus
completing the 70 weeks. Sealing the 70 weeks.</p>
<p>There are no weeks floating around in the vacuum as some people
believe. That’s not the way bible prophecy works. Either it is fulfilled
or it is not fulfilled. This was fulfilled perfectly. The hebrew is a
bit obscure, but you don't need to speak perfect hebrew to interpret it
correctly. You only need to use the internet.</p>
<p>Understanding that the 70 weeks are complete, Daniel 9 is consistent
with Daniel 12 in identifying the "Abomination of Desolation" with the
Muhammad's temples complex above the Holy Place in Jerusalem.</p>
<h5 id="north-and-south_DOT_"><span id="anchor-170"></span>North and
south.</h5>
<p>And the third to understand of the 3 mentions in the Tanakh of the
sequence "Abomination of Desolation" is that of Daniel 11.</p>
<p>Daniel 11 anticipates how control over Jerusalem and the territory of
Solomon's Israel alternate between northern forces and southern forces,
represented in history by different names.</p>
<p>In the narration of Daniel 11 <a href="#fn654" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref654" role="doc-noteref"><sup>654</sup></a> it can be observed
how the power over the territory over and around Jerusalem, since the
Medo-Persian alliance takes control, has been alternating between forces
of the north and forces of the south <a href="#fn655"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref655"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>655</sup></a>. Some characters can be identified
such as Alexander the Great, some Antiochus, some Ptolemies, some Caesar
and some periods such as the Byzantine, the first Muslim, the Crusades
and the second Muslim period.</p>
<p>The key, as always, to be able to understand a passage of the
scriptures, is Our Lord Jesus Christ. It should first be noted that the
word H1285 <a href="#fn656" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref656"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>656</sup></a>, translated as “covenant”, is only
used by Daniel on 6 occasions and always to represent the Holy pact
between God and his people. This allows us to identify that in the
narrative Jesus Christ is represented by the phrase "the Prince of the
Covenant" or "the Leader of the Covenant". And this allows establishing
a central point in time to the narration and thus being able to map the
history of the territory of the current Israel with the narration.</p>
<p>Understanding that the time of "the Prince of the Covenant" in Daniel
11 corresponds to the time of Jesus Christ, then the moment in which
Daniel 11 mentions the "Abomination of Desolation" can be mapped to the
time of control by the early Muslim period over Jerusalem, and with the
time when the Muslim temples complex was built on the Holy Mount in
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The three mentions in the Tanakh of the "Abomination of Desolation"
are consistent in identifying it with Muhammad's temples complex above
of the Holy Place in Jerusalem.</p>
<h4 id="israel_DOT_"><span id="anchor-171"></span>Israel.</h4>
<p>The main fulfilled prophecy that tells us that the year of the return
of Yeshua, of Jesus Christ, of Our Lord, of the King of Kings, of the
Meshiakh of Israel, it’s very close, even if we do not know the day or
the hour, it’s the existence of Israel for less than the last 100
years.</p>
<p>In Deuteronomy 29 and 30 the end is announced from the beginning, it
says that: after Jehovah
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>r</strong>ooted them out of their land
in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into
another land<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn657"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref657"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>657</sup></a></strong></strong> ; and:
<strong><strong>“all the nations will say, Why has Yahweh done this to
this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean? Then men will
say, Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their
fathers, which he made with them when he brought them out of the land of
Egypt, and went and served other gods and worshiped them, gods that they
didn’t know and that he had not given to them” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn658" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref658"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>658</sup></a></strong></strong>; and
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>when a</strong><strong>ll these things
have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before
you" </strong><strong><a href="#fn659" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref659" role="doc-noteref"><sup>659</sup></a></strong></strong>;
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>THEN</strong><strong> Yahweh your God
will release you from captivity, have compassion on you, and will return
and gather you from all the peoples where Yahweh your God has scattered
you. If your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from
there Yahweh your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you
back. Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers
possessed, and </strong><strong>YOU</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>WILL</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>POSSESS</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>IT</strong><strong>. He will do you good, and increase
your numbers more than your fathers” </strong><strong><a href="#fn660"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref660"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>660</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Since the time of Moses, more than 1400 years before Jesus Christ, it
was announced everything that would happen to the people of Jacob, to
the people of Israel, the chosen people of Jehovah.</p>
<p>First they would be blessed with the promised land, with the land in
which King David and King Solomon reigned between the year 1000 before
Jesus Christ and 930 before Jesus Christ, and then they would be cursed
for breaking the pact and worshiping other Gods. And Nebuchadnezzar
would be in charge to execute one of the most important moments of such
curses when he invades the only thing left to invade, Jerusalem, in the
year 587 or 586 before Jesus Christ, at which time the temple built by
Solomon almost 400 years before was completely destroyed. Moment from
which, the descendants of Jacob, the Israelites, could never again buy
and sell land, to be owners of that land, until the year 1948, more than
2500 years later, when God began to fulfill his promise to bring them
back to their land.</p>
<p>The birth of the current country of Israel was announced almost 3500
years before by the Creator of heaven and earth, who tells us:
<strong>“Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is
no other. I am God, and there is none like me. I declare the end from
the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done. I
say: My counsel will stand, and I will do all that I please. I call a
ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country.
Yes, I have spoken. I will also bring it to pass. I have planned. I will
also do it. Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, who are far from
righteousness! I bring my righteousness near. It is not far off, and my
salvation will not wait. I will grant salvation to Zion, my glory to
Israel” <a href="#fn661" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref661"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>661</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Jehovah also speaks to us through Jeremiah. In Jeremiah 29 to 33 He
gives various details of what is only happening until now.</p>
<p>First it mentions that <strong>"After seventy years are accomplished
for Babylon, I will visit you and perform my good word toward you, in
causing you to return to this place” <a href="#fn662"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref662"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>662</sup></a></strong>. Those seventy years
range from when Daniel is taken into exile to Babylon in 607 before
Jesus Christ until some of the exiles return to Jerusalem from Babylon
in 537 before Jesus Christ with the permission of Cyrus.</p>
<p>But then it also tells us about another time when Yahweh says that
<strong>"I will turn again your captivity, and I will gather you from
all the nations, and from all the places where I have driven you, says
Yahweh. I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to
be carried away captive” <a href="#fn663" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref663" role="doc-noteref"><sup>663</sup></a></strong>, and that
<strong>“behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will reverse the
captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh. I will cause them
to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will
POSSESS IT” <a href="#fn664" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref664"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>664</sup></a></strong>, and that <strong>“in
that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off
your neck, and will burst your bonds. Strangers WILL NO MORE make them
their bondservants” <a href="#fn665" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref665"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>665</sup></a></strong>, and that <strong>“Jacob
will return, and will be quiet and at ease. No one will make him afraid”
<a href="#fn666" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref666"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>666</sup></a></strong>, and that <strong>“Their
children also will be as before, and their congregation will be
established before me. I will punish all who oppress them” <a
href="#fn667" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref667"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>667</sup></a></strong>, and that <strong>“At
that time, says Yahweh, I will be the God of all the families of Israel,
and they will be my people” <a href="#fn668" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref668" role="doc-noteref"><sup>668</sup></a></strong>, and that
<strong>“I will build you again, and you will be built, O virgin of
Israel. You will again be adorned with your tambourines, and will go out
in the dances of those who make merry. Again you will plant vineyards on
the mountains of Samaria. The planters will plant, and will enjoy its
fruit” <a href="#fn669" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref669"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>669</sup></a></strong>, and that they
<strong>“Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout for the CHIEF of the
nations” <a href="#fn670" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref670"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>670</sup></a></strong>, and that
<strong>“Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather
them from the UTTERMOST parts of the earth, along with the blind and the
lame,the woman with child and her who travails with child together. They
will return as a great company” <a href="#fn671" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref671" role="doc-noteref"><sup>671</sup></a></strong>, and that
<strong>“Hear Yahweh’s word, you nations, and declare it in the distant
islands. Say, He who scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as
a shepherd does his flock" <a href="#fn672" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref672" role="doc-noteref"><sup>672</sup></a></strong>, and that
Jerusalem <strong>“will NOT BE plucked up or thrown down ANY MORE
FOREVER” <a href="#fn673" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref673"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>673</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Jeremiah was a prophet who announced, according to Jeremiah 21, that
Jehovah would deliver what was left of Judah and Jerusalem to
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that this king would not spare them
or have compassion or mercy. That Jerusalem would be burned and given up
and that he who would turn to the Chaldeans, to those who had Jerusalem
besieged, he would live. And that Zedekiah, the king of Judah, would be
taken prisoner to Babylon. And in Jeremiah 26 tells us that Jeremiah is
threatened with death for prophesying against Jerusalem. He also
prophesies, according to Jeremiah 29, that the captivity in Babylon
would be long and that they should build and cultivate and eat the fruit
of the crop, marry and have children, and seek peace and pray for the
peace of the Babylonians because the peace of Babylon it is the peace of
the captives.</p>
<p>All these prophecies that no one wanted to hear, made him end up
imprisoned in the courtyard of the house of Zedekiah, the king of Judah.
And while being prisoner, according to Jeremiah 32, Jehovah commands him
to buy a piece of land from a his cousin named Hanameel as a sign that
one day <strong>“<strong>H</strong>ouses and fields and vineyards shall
be <strong>POSSESSED</strong> again in this land” <a href="#fn674"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref674"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>674</sup></a></strong>, the land of Israel.</p>
<p>Jeremiah buys the land from his cousin, being imprisoned in the house
of the king and knowing that Nebuchadnezzar is about to invade
Jerusalem, as sign that one day
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>H</strong>ouses and fields and
vineyards shall be <strong>POSSESSED</strong> again in this
land<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn675" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref675" role="doc-noteref"><sup>675</sup></a></strong></strong>,
the Israelite’s land.</p>
<p>This prophecy is only fulfilled until the 20th century after Jesus
Christ, less than 100 years ago, when the country of Israel was founded
in 1948, and the descendants of Abraham did return to POSSESS land in
what is now Israel.</p>
<p>Jehovah also announces, according to Jeremiah 32, that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>B</strong>ehold, I will gather them
out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in
my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this
place, and I will cause them to dwell safely<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn676" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref676"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>676</sup></a></strong></strong>, and that
<strong><strong>“Fields WILL BE BOUGHT in this land, about which you
say, It is desolate, without man or animal” </strong><strong><a
href="#fn677" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref677"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>677</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Jehovah announces in Jeremiah 16 that <strong>“behold, the days come,
says Yahweh, that it will no more be said, As Yahweh lives, who brought
up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, As Yahweh
lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north,
and from all the countries where he had driven them. I will bring them
again into their land that I gave to their fathers" <a href="#fn678"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref678"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>678</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>This prophecy, according to which YHWH will be known as the one who
gathered the Jews of all the nations into which He had scattered them,
into the land that is now Israel, just as He had announced thousands of
years before, is already starting to come true.</p>
<p>Isaiah also prophesies in Isaiah 11 that God
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>wil</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>a</strong>ssemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather
together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the
earth<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn679" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref679"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>679</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>In Ezekiel 11, Jehovah announces that <strong>“I will gather you from
the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been
scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel” <a href="#fn680"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref680"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>680</sup></a></strong>. And in Ezekiel 37,
Jehovah says that <strong>“I will make them one nation in the land, on
the mountains of Israel. One king will be king to them all. They will no
longer be two nations. They won’t be divided into two kingdoms any more
at all” <a href="#fn681" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref681"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>681</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>In Ezekiel 36, God tells Ezekiel to <strong>"tell the house of
Israel, The Lord Yahweh says: I don’t do this for your sake, house of
Israel, BUT FOR MY HOLY NAME, which you have profaned among the nations
where you went” <a href="#fn682" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref682"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>682</sup></a></strong>, <strong>“I will take you
from among the nations and gather you out of all the countries, and will
bring you into your own land” <a href="#fn683" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref683" role="doc-noteref"><sup>683</sup></a></strong>, <strong>“I
don’t do this for your sake, says the Lord Yahweh. Let it be known to
you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, house of Israel” <a
href="#fn684" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref684"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>684</sup></a></strong>. And that <strong>"The
land that was desolate will be tilled instead of being a desolation in
the sight of all who passed by. They will say, This land that was
desolate has become like the garden of Eden. The waste, desolate, and
ruined cities are fortified and inhabited. Then the nations that are
left around you will know that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places,
and planted that which was desolate. I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I
will do it” <a href="#fn685" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref685"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>685</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>The existence of present-day Israel is a unique case in the entire
history of humanity. The smallest nation on the entire planet was
dispersed all over the planet and after thousands of years of being
dispersed all over the planet, now, reunited, owns the same territory
that it had at the beginning of its existence, just as it was written
that would happen, hundreds of years before being dispersed, and
thousands, listen well, THOUSANDS of years before it happened. And it
preserves its culture, its customs, its sacred book and its original
language.</p>
<p>There is no other case like it in ALL the history of HUMANITY. If
that is NOT a HYPER-MEGA-SUPER PROPHECY, I don't know my mom's name.</p>
<p>But that’s not all.</p>
<p>In Amos 9, God announces that <strong>“I will bring my people Israel
back from captivity, and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and
inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them.
They shall also make gardens, and eat their fruit. I will plant them on
their land, and they WILL NO MORE be plucked up out of their land which
I have given them, says Yahweh your God” <a href="#fn686"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref686"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>686</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Israel is here to stay. Promise of the Creator God of Heaven and
Earth.</p>
<h4 id="details_DOT_"><span id="anchor-172"></span>Details.</h4>
<p>As for the chapters about which there are doubts, due to the details,
it is worth mentioning the following issues:</p>
<h5 id="delivery_DOT_"><span
id="anchor-173"></span><strong>Delivery</strong>.</h5>
<p>In Revelation 12 John says that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong>here appeared a great wonder
in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet,
and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: <strong>A</strong>nd she
being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be
delivered<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn687"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref687"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>687</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Without coming to worship the stars, which would be idolatry, and
without coming to think that they influence our personality, which would
be occultism or witchcraft, some christians accept that God gives us
signs using the stars to identify milestones of prophecies fulfillment.
If we accept this, and bearing in mind that this description is between
the trumpets and the bowls in the narrative of the book of Revelation,
and that there are only two verses in the whole bible in which the angel
Michael is mentioned in prophecy, one in Daniel 12 <a href="#fn688"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref688" role="doc-noteref"><sup>688</sup></a>
and another in Revelation 12 <a href="#fn689" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref689" role="doc-noteref"><sup>689</sup></a>, and that in both
occurrences the narratives seem to refer to similar events, we have to
locate the Revelation 12 narrative in sync with Daniel 12.</p>
<p>If we do this, there is only one possible configuration of the sky in
the which this signal could have occurred in the sky: on September 23 of
2017. And as a significant fact we have that it corresponded with the
end of a very important annual biblical feast: the feast of
Trumpets.</p>
<p>The Revelation 12 configuration has 12 stars above the head of the
woman: the 9 stars of Leo and 3 more: Mercury, Mars and Venus. It has
the moving star Jupiter, which traditionally represents the King,
emerging from the center of the woman, has the Sun "clothing" the woman
and has the moon at the woman's feet. Other candidates like August 29 of
439, or September 11 of 3 before Jesus Christ, or the one in August 16
of 3 before Jesus Christ simply do not meet all the features.</p>
<p>The woman would be Israel and it would mean the beginning of the
spiritual birth of Abraham's descendants as a nation, the time when the
inhabitants of Israel begin to be born into the kingdom of heaven by
accepting their Meshiakh: Yeshua HaMashiakh, better known as Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>This spiritual birth of the Israelites, according to the statistics
of the first and only organization in the Israel of 2021 that has a
bible school run by people born in Israel and believers in Yeshua, the
organization “One for Israel”, has already started. Growth of people
born in Israel who are new believers in Yeshua seems to be exponential,
according to this organization.</p>
<p>If Michael's synchronism is correct, another great synchronism in the
book of Revelation can be established:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The time of the first 6 trumpets,</li>
<li>The time of the two witnesses of Revelation 11 <a href="#fn690"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref690"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>690</sup></a>,</li>
<li>The time of the woman in the desert of Revelation 12 <a
href="#fn691" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref691"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>691</sup></a>, and</li>
<li>The time of the first beast of Revelation 13 <a href="#fn692"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref692"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>692</sup></a>,</li>
</ol>
<p>correspond to exactly the same period of time and lasts 1260
days.</p>
<p>Trumpets that occur just after the spiritual birth of Israel, of the
time when Israel accepts its Meshiakh. Delivery that occurs at the end
of the first 6 seals of the book of Revelation and before the rapture
that occurs between the sixth and seventh seals.</p>
<h5 id="messengers_DOT_"><span id="anchor-174"></span>7 messengers.</h5>
<p>If in Revelation 12 the phrase “a great wonder in heaven” refers to
some configuration in the sky, then the phrase in Revelation 15 also
would have to be about some stellar configuration when John tells us
that: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong>nd I saw another sign
in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last
plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn693" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref693"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>693</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>The only "great" and “marvellous” configuration in the sky after
2017, and quite strange in general, that can fit the description, is the
one that will occur on September 8 of 2040, corresponding to the Feast
of Trumpets of that year, when there will be a conjunction of the 7
mobile stars, or classic planets of the antiquity, which can be seen
without the aid of a telescope: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury,
the Sun and the Moon.</p>
<p>In less than 20 degrees this very rare stellar alignment will be
observed. With less than 20 degrees of angular distance between the
objects. The previous one occurred on July 3 of 710. Very rare
indeed.</p>
<p>This heavenly configuration could be the announcement, the sign, that
marks the moment in which the 7 angels of Revelation 15 begin their
activity of pouring over the final 7 bowls of God's Wrath. This signal
would mark the beginning of the bowls, that is, the beginning of the
last trumpet of the Book of Revelation.</p>
<h5 id="babylon_DOT_"><span id="anchor-175"></span>Babylon.</h5>
<p>The great prostitute of Revelation 17 and the great Babylon of
Revelation 18, they would be one and the same. And it refers to all the
people who are not raptured and who will die without having accepted
Jesus Christ during the trumpets or bowls. It would be all the people
who stay in the earth, in Babylon, and die physically, during the
trumpets or the bowls, without having accepted Christ. The rapture would
correspond to the moment when, according to Revelation 18, John says
that: <strong>“I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of
her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues" <a href="#fn694" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref694" role="doc-noteref"><sup>694</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>The end of the destruction of the Great Babylon corresponds with the
end of the seals, the trumpets and the bowls, all at the same time.
Because let us remember that the last “seal” are the 7 “trumpets” and
the last “trumpet” are the 7 “bowls”. After that begins the reign of
Jesus Christ from Israel for a thousand years.</p>
<h4 id="reign_DOT_"><span id="anchor-176"></span>Reign.</h4>
<p>After the destruction of the great Babylon, the wrath of God, the
bowls, the reign begins. Jesus Christ comes down from heaven with the
countless multitude clothed in white linen, the one spoken in Revelation
7 <a href="#fn695" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref695"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>695</sup></a>, and who went out to meet him
according to Paul <a href="#fn696" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref696"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>696</sup></a>. All the people that were caught
up to heaven. Crowd that will be ruled by Jesus Christ and 144,000
resurrected men for a thousand years.</p>
<p>A thousand years of a reign with authentic peace because all the
nations and peoples will be made up of people who, prior to said
reigning, had already accepted Jesus Christ as their King. People who
were willing to die for His cause and died to everything they were, or
as Paul says: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> have been
crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives
in me<strong>” </strong><strong><a href="#fn697" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref697" role="doc-noteref"><sup>697</sup></a></strong></strong>.
Peoples and nations made up of people in whom Jesus Christ already
reigns in their hearts.</p>
<p>It is the SPIRITUAL beginning WITH the PHYSICAL presence of the King
of Kings, of the Meshiakh of YHWH, of that new earth with a new heavens
that Isaiah announces in his last two chapters. The SPIRITUAL beginning
WITHOUT the PHYSICAL presence of Jesus Christ began from his
resurrection. These beginnings are only SPIRITUAL because the offspring
of Adam have not yet been destroyed.</p>
<p>The PHYSICAL beginning of that NEW earth with a NEW heavens,
according to Revelation 21, happens AFTER the resurrection of ALL the
dead. And this only happens until after the thousand years of the reign
of Jesus Christ from Israel, the Israel that is already here.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ does not come to reign over anyone who has not accepted
him as king prior to that time. He is not coming to reign over
Babylon.</p>
<p>This is GOOD news for those who already have Jesus Christ as King,
but they don’t SEEM so good to those who don’t have him as King.</p>
<h1 id="part-3_DOT_-periphery_DOT_"><span id="anchor-177"></span>PART 3.
PERIPHERY.</h1>
<h3 id="beliefs_DOT_"><span id="anchor-178"></span>Beliefs.</h3>
<p>At this point of the presentation it can already be said that the
main objective of giving you some GOOD news and others that don't SEEM
good, it's already been fulfilled. However, not the entire set of
questions that were posed at the beginning of the presentation have been
answered and that was a third objective: kill all the birds with one
stone.</p>
<p>The goal of this part 3 of the presentation is to put forward a whole
series of topics that are related to the Truth, to what the bible
affirms, and to the word "science". And in this way kill the pending
birds.</p>
<p>Some of these topics, very few, can be related to the concept of
technical creativity, that criterion that this presentation considers
necessary to truly discern what is an objective, verifiable knowledge
and in which no faith is needed, that which we like to call scientific.
That is why this whole part 3 of the presentation is under the heading
of simply “beliefs”.</p>
<p>In some cases what most people believe is not the same thing that
your host believes. For beliefs that your host considers false, mostly
popular, generally only the reasons against the belief are presented,
and for those which your host considers true, mostly unpopular,
generally only the reasons in favor of the belief are presented. This
does allows the presentations to be simpler and more dynamic.</p>
<p>Most of the beliefs presented here have to do with the bible. If
those beliefs presented here as false are not false, or those presented
here as true are not true, the bible does not seem to be inspired by the
God who does not lie.</p>
<h5 id="principles_DOT_"><span id="anchor-179"></span>Principles.</h5>
<p>Obviously the most important of all beliefs for a Christian is that
Jesus Christ is alive because he was resurrected. It is the foundation
of the believer in Jesus Christ. As Paul says in 1st Corinthians 15:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>i</strong>f Christ be not risen, then
is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain<strong>”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn698" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref698"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>698</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ spoke of Noah, Jonah, Moses, and the Torah, which
includes the book of Genesis, as something completely true. So, if Jesus
Christ is alive because he was resurrected, we may not understand all
the details of why the whole bible has to be true but it has to be.</p>
<p>Thus, the two fundamental principles, which must be taken into
account in any point analyzed from here on, are the ones already
analyzed at the beginning of this presentation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is a Creator, designer and intelligent, of all plants, animals
and people on this planet.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ is alive because, after dying on the cross, the Creator
raised him on the third day.</li>
</ol>
<p>If these two fundamental points are denied, ignored, or not taken
into account in the next presentations, it is rationally much more
difficult to accept these presentations. On the other hand, if these two
principles are understood as true it is much easier to accept these
presentations. So: if you don't understand them as true, assume them as
hypothetically true, as an intellectual exercise, when you reason about
the following presentations.</p>
<h5 id="evidence_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-180"></span>Evidence.</h5>
<p>Another important point to note beforehand is that: in the support of
each belief the word “evidence” is used in the context of the person who
has studied the subject of the belief.</p>
<p>This annotation is made because: what for a person can be evidence,
to another it may simply be a worthless statement. And this situation
depends both on the level of skepticism of the person, as well as the
knowledge that the person has on the subject of the presented
“belief”.</p>
<p>If you have not studied the subject, the evidence presented may seem
worthless. You better study it and then take a position.</p>
<p>It is because of this subjectivity that when an affirmation is
presented as evidence, it is based on what other people, who have
dedicated more time than me, and probably more time than you too, to the
study of the particular subject, those people, ALSO consider it as
evidence.</p>
<h3 id="the-truth_DOT_"><span id="anchor-181"></span>The Truth.</h3>
<p>The Truth according to the bible is something that is lived, that is
experienced. According to John 14, Jesus Christ says:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>I</strong> am the way, the truth, and
the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me<strong>"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn699" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref699"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>699</sup></a></strong></strong>. Jesus Christ is
the Truth and to know the Truth is to know Him. John, in 1st John 2
tells us that: <strong><strong>“</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e who
says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn700" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref700"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>700</sup></a></strong></strong>. He who says
that he knows Jesus Christ must live like he lived. This way of living
is by loving, John explains in 1st John 4 that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>H</strong><strong>e who doesn’t love
doesn’t know God, for God is love” </strong><strong><a href="#fn701"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref701"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>701</sup></a></strong></strong>. And Jesus
Christ explains to us, according to John 15, that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>G</strong><strong>reater love has no
one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn702" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref702"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>702</sup></a></strong></strong>. To give the
whole person. Jesus Christ has been giving us his complete person, his
life, from the creation of Heavens and Earth.</p>
<p>Thus, the goal of Life itself is to know The Truth. The truth is not
only information. It is a person, it is Jesus Christ himself.</p>
<h3 id="the-search_DOT_"><span id="anchor-182"></span>The search.</h3>
<p>The personal search for Truth begins when we have a functioning brain
in a body that can perceive its surroundings. It is the process of
forming mental models that are consistent with the perceptions that said
body receives.</p>
<p>It is not very different from the social process of searching for The
Truth.</p>
<p>The human being has developed languages to express models that are
consistent with the observations of his environment and thus be able to
predict outcomes and modify his environment by building objects that
fulfill the expected functionality.</p>
<p>These languages can be named with the word "mathematics", these
models can be named with the word "theories", and these objects can be
named with the word “technologies”. We could also use more biblical
terms and therefore closer to the Truth. We could use terms such as
“logics”, due to its origin in the word “logos”, the term “names”, and
the term “creations”.</p>
<p>The problem lies in believing that knowing our environment, knowing
the Creation, is the same as knowing the Creator. It’s not the same.
Knowing the creator is the reason for our existence, the cause and
destiny, the goal, the beginning and end, the only thing that can
satisfy the human being.</p>
<p>Knowing the creation is not enough to know the Creator. Jesus Christ
warned us “I am the way, the truth and the life”. There is no other way.
He is the way. There is no other. That's why at the end He is The TRUTH.
That which we seek where it is not: in Creation.</p>
<p>The only mental model that can satisfy the knowledge of The Reality,
of The Truth, is the mind of Jesus Christ. The only name that
appropriates the fundamental reason of the human being is Jesus Christ
himself. When Jesus Christ lives in me and I die to myself, I reach The
Truth. That which I seek so much, that which I desire so much.</p>
<p>We are in search of The Truth.</p>
<h3 id="supernatural_DOT_"><span id="anchor-183"></span>Supernatural.</h3>
<p>Your host's position on the word "miracle" and the word
“supernatural” is based on biblical concepts.</p>
<p>This means that “miracles” does not mean anything different from
"signs" or "wonders". This means that no matter how amazed at a
WONDERFUL event someone gets with a miracle, it doesn’t mean that the
“WONDERFUL” event doesn’t have a RATIONAL explanation. And that it is
precisely because it is so difficult to rationally explain it, that it
is also consider a SIGN that the Creator is intervening in the WONDERFUL
event.</p>
<p>This position is directly related to the word “supernatural”, which
does not really exist in the hebrew. It has an origin from latin. The
latin word "natura" is so contrary to the bible that it doesn’t appear
even once in the old testament of the Vulgate. It only appears deformed
2 times as “naturae” and 1 time as “naturam” in the Vulgate Old
Testament. The reason is that the word itself means "born" and implies,
in its widespread use, that there is no creator. Things are just “born”,
ALONE, by them selves, somehow.</p>
<p>Thus, for your host, “supernatural” simply means above what is
“natural”, from what is simply “born”, that is to say, that it HAS a
creator. If something has a creator it is “supernatural”. So anything
created by man is as "supernatural" as that created by our CREATOR.</p>
<p>That's why your host avoids the word "nature" like the plague. He
only uses it in quotes from other texts or very rarely as a synonym for
THIS creation, what is observed on this planet. And in that case I only
use it to differentiate what was created by our creator from what was
created by us. In general, I prefer to use the word “CREATION”.</p>
<p>The so-called "nature" is already in itself something SUPERNATURAL,
because it was created. It seems to some that plants, animals, and
people were simply “born”, in quotes, ALONE, by them selves. But if the
process is analyzed, the need for a CREATOR becomes evident. That is why
your host prefers to use the word CREATION instead of the word
"nature".</p>
<p>Just as the word miracle, the word supernatural does not have, for
this host, a connotation of the inexplicable or the irrational. The fact
that we do not know the explanation of something does not mean that it
doesn't have it. When we get to know our Creator better we will know and
understand better the so-called “SUPERNATURAL” processes.</p>
<h3 id="science_DOT_"><span id="anchor-184"></span>Science.</h3>
<p>Words like “science”, “knowledge”, “know”, “fact” in practice are
related to the word “certainty”. Phrases like "it’s scientifically
proven”, “it’s not that we believe it, it’s that we know it”, “I know
that very well”, “that is a known fact” are used to denote "certainty",
to denote veracity in what is being said. The use of these words is
related to the concept of Truth.</p>
<p>Ironically, the most popular criterion for solving the problem of
demarcation, that is, the criterion for determining whether a hypothesis
is scientific or not, is the “falsifiability” criterion, that is to say
that said hypothesis can be contradicted by observation or logic. Just
the opposite of "certainty": "Falsibility" implies the absence of
“certainty”. And all methods recognized as scientific include being able
to repeat the experimental observation of the expected results for a
falsifiable hypothesis.</p>
<p>Confidence is gained as experimentation can be repeated and that is
why the word “science” ends up being related to the word "certainty"
even though a scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable to be
scientific, according to the most popular criteria.</p>
<p>The problem with any scientific or non-scientific method is the same
problem presented by any system whether social, political, economic,
religious, educational, judicial, military, technological, scientific,
etc. The problem is the heart of man. The problem is with the system’s
user or with the system’s fundamental parts. Those users or parts of the
system have a DECEPTIVE heart. There isn't a good one. Not even one.</p>
<p>The human being can change, restructure, redesign any system, but if
its parts, the user, or the designer of it, are damaged, then the system
will fail.</p>
<p>Even the criteria presented in this presentation, technical
creativity, as a criterion for the demarcation problem, a criterion
presented as more reliable than the popular one for determining whether
a model or theory is scientific or not, will also fail.</p>
<p>Technical creativity seems a stricter criterion than simple
repetition of observations because it only admits concrete results,
concrete objects, that have a function for the life of the common
person. It implies engineering, building something: airplanes, shoes,
cell phones, microscopes, telephones, watches, televisions, hammers,
trains, telescopes, computers, pots, buildings, transistors,
automobiles, satellites, refrigerators, washing machines, polishers,
backhoe loaders, MACHINES that make MACHINES, factories that use
machines made by others factories to build OBJECTS. If a discipline
builds repeatedly something useful for the human being, qualifies as,
quote and quote, “knowledge” that is objective, verifiable and that does
not require a faith. It qualifies as a “science”.</p>
<p>Technical creativity excludes any discipline that does not build its
object of study or something with its objects of study. It studies the
stars but does not build them and does not build anything with them?. It
does not qualify. It studies elementary particles but doesn't build them
and doesn't build anything with them? It does not qualify. It studies
time but doesn't build it and doesn't build anything with it?. It does
not qualify. It studies gravity but does not build it and does not build
anything with it?. It does not qualify. It studies genes but it does
build them and does not build anything with them?. Guess what?: IT DOES
NOT QUALIFY.</p>
<p>That means that the scientific theories that speak of this kind of
things are not so “scientific”. They are not really that objective,
verifiable knowledge and in which no faith is needed. They are a field
of study, they are a set of hypotheses that have not been validated with
a TECHNICAL CREATIVITY.</p>
<p>In the criterion of technical creativity what is repeated is not an
observation but a usable object.</p>
<p>When it is rationally impossible to say: "I don't think we will
travel to the stars”, when it is rationally impossible to say: “I do not
believe in time travel”, for the common person, in the same way in that
it is now rationally impossible to say: "I do not believe in airplanes",
for an ordinary person, THEN we can say technical creativity has already
confirmed the "scientific" theories that explain space and time at that
level.</p>
<p>It seems more difficult for the technical creativity criterion to
fail but it can fail. The problem is in the user. It’s in the heart and
mind of the criterion’s user.</p>
<p>It will always be possible to argue and debate that a theory was
completely necessary to build this or that object and try to validate
something that the one who first built it never thought of. We have
already talked about the case with the transistor. Or, it will always be
possible to build an object from a partially understood phenomenon and
then deny that such knowledge was necessary in the construction of said
object.</p>
<p>The technical creativity criterion may fail. The problem is in the
human heart. The creator warns us when he says, according to Jeremiah
17, which: <strong>"The heart is deceitful above all things and it is
exceedingly corrupt. Who can know it?" <a href="#fn703"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref703"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>703</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Science seeks The Truth but it cannot reach it.</p>
<h3 id="distances_DOT_"><span id="anchor-185"></span>Distances.</h3>
<p>We see lights in the sky. We perceive different frequencies emitted
by them. How far away are they? The simplest answer is: We do NOT know.
But the human being instead of admitting his ignorance, he supposes,
assumes things it cannot confirm, and draws conclusions based on those
assumptions.</p>
<p>Draw a dot on a sheet of paper. Put the sheet at a distance of your
arm, put a pencil between the sheet and your eyes. Close your left eye
and open the right eye. Put the dot on the sheet behind the tip of the
pencil, that is: line up your right eye, the tip of pencil and the point
on the sheet. Without moving your head, the pencil, or the sheet of
paper, now close the right eye and open the left eye. The pencil APPEARS
to have moved with respect to the point on the sheet. With how many
configurations, that is, distances of sheet, pencil and eyes can it
APPEAR that the pencil moves the SAME distance? Answer: as many as you
can count. For each one the angle between the lines of sight of each eye
to the OBJECT, that which some call Parallax, is different because it
DEPENDS on the distance from the sheet to the pencil, from the distance
from the BACKGROUND to the OBJECT in observation.</p>
<p>If this angle is to be calculated by measuring the angle of APPARENT
displacement of an object with respect to a background, one of two must
be fulfilled: either the distance from the background to the object is
known, or this distance must be several orders of magnitude greater than
the distance to be calculated in order to get an approximate value. This
second case is the origin of the word Parallax, because it ASSUMES that
the lines of sight from each point of observation, in this case each of
your eyes, to the point of reference in the BACKGROUND, in this case the
point in the sheet of paper, that which must be several orders of
magnitude farther than the distance to be calculated, they are PARALLEL.
They are ASSUMED parallel in order to be able to APPROXIMATE the angle
measured to the angle between the lines of vision of each eye, or points
of observation, to the OBJECT. The angle actually measured is the angle
between the line of sight of the second point of observation, in this
case the left eye, to the point of reference in the BACKGROUND, and the
line of sight from this SAME second point of observation to the OBJECT.
That is to say that the measured angle is APPROXIMATED to the APPARENT
angular displacement. In this approximation it’s also ASSUMED that the
OBJECT has not moved with respect to the first point of observation
neither with respect to the point of reference in the background.</p>
<p>The second option was the one used in the first approximate
calculations of the distance from the moon to the earth. The stars were
the background and these were ASSUMED several orders of magnitude more
distant than the moon. A reasonable assumption for the case of the
moon.</p>
<p>Measuring the apparent angle of displacement of an object with
respect to a background which CANNOT be assumed to be SEVERAL orders of
magnitude more distant than the object is TO ABUSE the approximation, it
is TO ASSUME TOO MUCH. It is no longer even an approximation, it is an
uncertainty. Nevertheless this is what is normally done to calculate the
famous angle Parallax with those lights that we see in the sky, with the
stars.</p>
<p>Imagine putting the pencil 8 kilometers or 5 miles away from your
eyes and placing it between you and a star. The dot on the sheet of
paper is now the star. AND THEN TRY TO MEASURE THE ANGLE THAT THE PENCIL
LOOKS LIKE to have moved with respect to the star when observing it from
the second eye, or when observing it with the best technology that you
can imagine but separating each observation only by 6 centimeters. And
with that measurement then calculate the distance from the pencil to
your eyes using a trigonometric calculation. Something like this would
be what it is to CALCULATE the APPROXIMATION for the distance to the
star believed to be the closest to Earth, Alpha Centauri. SOMETHING like
this, because in this example the distance from the eye to the star is
actually larger, by several orders of magnitude, than the distance from
the eye to the pencil and the approximation of the measured angle to the
desired angle is still valid. Thing we don't know in the case of stars
with respect to stars, that is to say the REAL case for Alpha Centauri,
and the approximation begins to be uncertainty.</p>
<p>The Parallax method is just an approximation and only works like
approximation if the measured angle can be approximated to the desired
angle. This is only possible if the BACKGROUND is several orders of
magnitude more distant than the distance to be measured. In the case of
stars what is actually rational and logical to ASSUME is that the star
for which you want calculate the distance is much closer to the other
stars than it is to this planet, that is to say that in reality the star
is part of the BACKGROUND !</p>
<p>In the case of the stars there is no method of public knowledge, that
men is using, to make the measurement of the angle between the lines of
sight of two points of observation to a particular star. Maybe we just
don't have the technology to do it yet.</p>
<p>Another alarm on the use of the Parallax method to approximate the
distance of a star should be the value of such measured angles. They are
too small. And in these attempts they even try separating the points of
observation as much as possible by making the observations at two
opposite ends of the earth’s cycle around the sun.</p>
<p>When the pencil is very far away the angle is very small. And when
the sheet is very close to the pencil, that is when the pencil begins to
be very close to the supposed background, it seems to move almost
nothing. The background is NOT as background as we thought it was.</p>
<p>The very small angles measured in the case of stars, see definition
of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc">arcsecond</a>,
of APPARENT angular displacement with respect to a SUPPOSED background
of unknown distance, they should be more an indicative that the star,
for which I want to calculate the distance, is part of the BACKGROUND,
and that therefore I cannot approximate the measured angle to the angle
between the two lines of sight to the star. ASSUMING that, it’s assuming
too much.</p>
<p>Those angles are actually EVIDENCE against the approximation and
hence against the use of the method. Those angles are easily within of
the margin of error of the measurement of an angle between two stars,
when these measurements are made one in spring and one in autumn, that
is to say at two opposite ends of the earth's cycle around the sun.</p>
<p>This Parallax method that assumes too much and is used to make an
APPROXIMATE and INDIRECT CALCULATION of the distance of a star is what
astronomy, cosmology, and the so-called sciences that study stars, they
call it DIRECT MEASUREMENT of stellar distances. Do me the favour !.
That's the DIRECT one! To make an APPROXIMATE and INDIRECT CALCULATION
we call it DIRECT MEASUREMENT! It's the best we have. Now imagine the
INDIRECT measurements.</p>
<p>Based on these approximate and indirect calculations for the objects
that we believe that they can be calculated, those that we believe are
closest, which are less than 0.07% of related objects and less than 0
POINT 000000000000, 22 ZEROS, one, percent, of those believed to be
visible in the universe, they begin to build what is known as the
“cosmic distance ladder”. Which is nothing more than a ladder of more
ASSUMPTIONS with which the cosmic distances are intended to be
established for those other lights that we observe in the sky.
Assumptions over assumptions over assumptions.</p>
<p>With instruments built with the highest human technology and making a
series of assumptions that so far are completely impossible to confirm,
unless we find a way of traveling to the stars, we believe that we know,
that we are certain, THAT is the ATTITUDE we have, of which is the
distance that a light that we observe in the sky has.</p>
<p>The truth is that we do not know.</p>
<p>We cannot reach The Truth of the very far, without having contact
with it.</p>
<h3 id="redshift_DOT_"><span id="anchor-186"></span>Redshift.</h3>
<p>To calculate approximations of the distance of a star sometimes we
assume that larger size means that is closer, sometimes we assume that
luminously connected objects are at the same distance, sometimes we
assume that greater perceived luminosity as emitted by the object
implies less distance, sometimes we suppose the mechanisms by means of
which light is emitted, and we sometimes assume that higher redshift
implies a greater distance, and based on these unverifiable assumptions
we do a whole series of calculations to arrive at conclusions that we
accept as true.</p>
<p>But for the sake of argument let us ASSUME, BELIEVE, ACCEPT that ALL,
absolutely ALL, those ASSUMPTIONS are true.</p>
<p>In the last millennium it was concluded that the universe is
expanding because one of those assumptions tells us that: a higher
redshift measurement for an object or a group of objects implies a
greater distance from earth of those objects.</p>
<p>But what happens when we find luminously CONNECTED objects that have
DIFFERENT redshifts? What about NGC-7603 or NGC-4319 in which several
objects are luminously CONNECTED but have DIFFERENT redshifts? Simple.
We ignore them because it implies that the assumptions contradict each
other. And that implies that the conclusions are BASELESS.</p>
<p>What happens when you plot "apparent brightness" against "redshifts"
of the Quasars we observe and it is found that the points in the diagram
are SPREAD all over the entire diagram and do not show a statistical
correlation? Simple. It is ignored. Because it implies that the
assumptions contradict each other. And that implies that the conclusions
are BASELESS.</p>
<p>If the assumption that the "redshift" tells us "distance", is FALSE,
then the MAIN argument for an expanding universe is just a FALLACY.</p>
<p>An expanding universe is the main argument for the famous Big-Bang,
that explosion of absolutely NOTHING caused by absolutely NOTHING,
because before the explosion there was NOTHING and NOTHING could have
caused it, and from which EVERYTHING supposedly came out. A logical
absurdity that even today some people accept without any problem because
it was what they were taught at school: that EVERYTHING came out of an
explosion of NOTHING caused by NOTHING.</p>
<p>The evidence shown by Quasars that the "redshift" does NOT indicate
"distance" is evidence that destroys the main argument to conclude that
the universe is expanding. Which in turn is the main argument to
conclude that it all started with an explosion. Which in turn is the
main basis for calculating its time of existence. Which in turn is an
argument for … blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>WE DO NOT KNOW the distances of those lights that we see in the sky,
but we are so proud, so haughty, so arrogant, so exalted, so rebellious,
that we refuse to admit our ignorance. We draw conclusions from an
expanding universe based on assumptions that we cannot confirm, and that
on the contrary we have found very strong evidence that falsify them,
and we call the process SCIENCE! Do me a favor!</p>
<p>The Truth of the far away we cannot reach if we do not have contact
with it.</p>
<h3 id="radioactive_DOT_"><span id="anchor-187"></span>Radioactive.</h3>
<p>For any supposed radiometric dating, we start from the following
assumptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Assuming the initial conditions are known.</li>
<li>Assuming that there are no external effects that alter the
conditions of the chemical elements measured.</li>
<li>Assuming that the rate of change, of radioactivity, of the measured
chemical elements has been maintained.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then:</p>
<p>I can calculate when these rocks or objects containing these
radioactive elements were formed.</p>
<p>Dating by radioactive elements is one of the most ABSURD ways of
using high technology to obtain completely useless results because it
assumes too many things impossible to verify.</p>
<p>But for the sake of argument let us ASSUME, BELIEVE, ACCEPT that ALL,
absolutely ALL, these ASSUMPTIONS are valid.</p>
<p>The rate of decay in these radioactive elements is approximated by
measuring how often the radioactive element decreases to half of it.
This data is called the half-life of the radioactive element.</p>
<p>It is ASSUMED that the radioactive element is always decaying at the
same rate. The half-life of the radioactive element is assumed to be NOT
changing. That it has been the same throughout history and during the
supposed billions of years that some rocks have been out there.</p>
<p>ACCEPTING the necessary assumptions, with this half-life one can
determine what is the maximum amount of time that can elapse before the
atoms, actually isotopes, of an initial quantity of said radioactive
element, lose the electrons that make it radioactive and said isotope
decays into an atom or isotope that is no longer radioactive, because
the energy in electrons is compensated by the energy of the nucleus.
When that happens the name of the element changes. It's not the same
element anymore because these are identified by the number of protons
and electrons. That is to say that the radioactive element ends up
disappearing, because its isotopes decayed into atoms or isotopes of
another element. Sometimes it is a chain of decays because not always a
radioactive element decays into a stable element but into another that
is also radioactive.</p>
<p>But what happens when for the SAME piece of rock, to which are
applied several and DIFFERENT methods of radioactive dating, we obtain
results in which one is a multiple, MULTIPLE, listen MULTIPLE, of the
other? We ignore them, because this would mean that our assumptions are
false. And that NONE of the dates are reliable.</p>
<p>ACCEPTING all necessary assumptions, for the most famous of all
radioactive elements, Carbon 14, it has been calculated that said half
life is about 5730 years. Carbon 14 decays into Nitrogen 14 by losing an
electron and releasing energy in the form of light. And for those
practical measurement purposes, and ACCEPTING all necessary assumptions,
the maximum time of existence of said radioactive element in any sample
it is 60 thousand years.</p>
<p>This means that if the sample is more than 60 thousand years old, it
is no longer expected to find absolutely ANYTHING of Carbon 14 because
everything would have decayed into Nitrogen 14.</p>
<p>But, what happens when an animal, THAT HAS JUST DIED, it gets Carbon
14 tested, and it turns out that it supposedly lived thousands of years
ago? We ignore it, because it would mean that our assumptions are false
and that the method does not work.</p>
<p>Or, what happens when the Carbon 14 test is done on two parts of the
SAME animal and the results have differences of thousands of years? We
ignore it, because it would mean that our assumptions are false and that
the method does not work, or that a part of the animal lived thousands
of years before the other, which is just absurd.</p>
<p>Or what happens when a part of a LIVING animal, listen: ALIVE, gets
Carbon 14 tested and it turns out that it supposedly lived thousands of
years ago? We ignore it, because it would mean that our assumptions are
false and that the method does not work.</p>
<p>Or, what happens when the SAME piece of animal is Carbon 14 tested in
different laboratories and one age turns out to be less than 20,000
years old and the other older than 28,000 years? We ignore it, because
it would mean that our assumptions are false and that the method does
not work.</p>
<p>Radiometric dating DOES NOT WORK.</p>
<p>But for the sake of argument let us ASSUME, BELIEVE, ACCEPT that it
works. LET'S ASSUME it works like a charm.</p>
<p>What happens when every time a Carbon 14 test is performed on some
piece of carbon on the planet we find that it has Carbon 14? We ignore
it, because it would mean that, according to the assumptions of
radiometric dating, those pieces of carbon CANNOT be more than 60
thousand years. And we don't like it because, if we don't believe the
bible, we want believe what we were taught in school.</p>
<p>Or what happens when every time a Carbon 14 test is performed on any
piece of diamond we find that it has Carbon 14? We ignore it because it
would mean that, according to the assumptions of radiometric dating,
those pieces of diamond CANNOT have more than 60 thousand years. And we
don't like it because, if we don't believe the bible, we want to believe
what we were taught in school.</p>
<p>Or what happens when every time a Carbon 14 test is performed on
dinosaur fossils we find that they have Carbon 14? We ignore it because
it would mean that, according to the assumptions of radiometric dating,
those dinosaur fossils CANNOT be more than 60 thousand years old. And we
don't like it because, if we don't believe the bible, we want to believe
what we were taught in school.</p>
<p>We cannot reach The Truth of the ancient past when we assume
something which cannot be verified today.</p>
<h3 id="helium_DOT_"><span id="anchor-188"></span>Helium.</h3>
<p>Helium is a gas that escapes from practically any container. And the
higher the temperature, the easier it is to escape.</p>
<p>If we find helium-filled balloons on the ceiling of a room where
there was a children's party, and we ask at what time was the party, and
the answer we get is that it was 8 days ago, we know there is evidence
indicating the contrary. The helium filled balloons would be on the
floor and not on the ceiling.</p>
<p>Of course, this conclusion implies having made some assumptions
similar to those made in radiometric dating: that the temperature of
helium in the balloons has not varied in large quantities, that the
balloons have not been refilled with helium, and that the balloons were
already filled with helium when the children's party happened.</p>
<p>Zircon is a mineral found in granite and other types of rocks. That
is to say that this zircon is spread all over the planet in every
mountain that has granite. That zircon is found in any part of the
earth's crust. The one that is made of granite.</p>
<p>And similar to what we did with the dating assumptions by Carbon 14,
LET US ASSUME, ACCEPT, BELIEVE that the assumptions of Uranium dating
hold for these bits of zircon, and LET'S ASSUME that the Helium in those
bits of zircon gets generated when the Uranium that was in the zircon
decays into Lead.</p>
<p>What happens when we find Helium in those pieces of zircon that have
been dated to billions of years and were found at temperatures between
100 and 270 degrees Celsius and between 1000 and 4000 meters deep in the
earth's crust?</p>
<p>What happens is that we have evidence that indicates that this
granite cannot have been formed before a few thousand years ago. If they
had been there the past hundred thousand years, there would be nothing,
absolutely NO Helium in those zircon bits, zero, zip, nothing, NADA,
nadita, nada. That is to say that with that Helium in that Zircon we
have evidence that the earth's crust, that which is made of granite that
contains said zircon, it’s only a few thousand years old, and not
hundred of thousands, and much less billions of years old as we were
taught at school.</p>
<p>Either the assumptions on which the Uranium datings are based are not
fulfilled., or there should be absolutely NO Helium in those bits of
Zircon.</p>
<p>The Truth of the ancient past is unattainable when we assume things
that cannot be verified at present.</p>
<h3 id="factories_DOT_"><span id="anchor-189"></span>Factories.</h3>
<p>Imagine a factory that produces cars. A completely automated factory
without human intervention. This factory produces all the energy it
consumes. It has its own power generators, its own mechanisms of storage
and internal transport of energy, and its own mechanism for using said
energy. Any interaction with the exterior is controlled by automatic
systems. It can verify quantity and quality in the income of each of the
inputs used through specialized gates for each input. It has machines
that can construct and deconstruct pathways for transportation of the
machines that it needs to operate. This factory has machines that
operating together, they can build each of the machines that the factory
needs to operate, including the machines themselves. The cars that
produces are verified by machines and corrections can be made to the
minor detail after fabrication. It has automated quality control
mechanisms, input and output control, transport and communication of
information and energy. It also has machines that they can repair damage
anywhere in the factory. These machines can repair any machine or
transportation system, communication, energy production, distribution,
manufacturing, control, support, its physical structures, etc. These
machines can repair any part of the factory. This factory can even, in
an emergency, go into self destruction mode. It is a factory that does
not need human intervention. Fully automated.</p>
<p>Imagine that this factory is so automated that it can copy itself. It
can start building all its machines internally, begin to separate at one
end of its internal structure these machines and end up building another
separate physical structure with exactly the same characteristics as
itself. Another factory just like itself. All the information, all the
programs, all the mechanisms of control of how to do it are within the
factory itself. It does not need to communicate with the outside to
perform the duplication task. It only needs the same inputs that it
receives to manufacture automobiles to be able to duplicate itself.</p>
<p>Now imagine that this factory cannot be seen with the naked eye
because it is too small, a microscope is needed. It has only a few
thousand cubic micrometers in volume. And the cars that it produces are
a few thousand cubic nanometers in volume.</p>
<p>The cars produced by this factory have a respective speed to its size
3 times greater than that of a car in common use by human beings. In
addition, their work efficiency, regarding the amount of energy used for
its operation, is 60%. That is to say that it is much greater than the
efficiency of a car in common use by humans, which only has a 10% work
efficiency with respect to the amount of energy used for its
operation.</p>
<p>Now let us take a car in common use by human beings and let's take it
apart: piece by piece, nut by nut, bolt by bolt, circuit by circuit.</p>
<p>Suppose each part is carefully numbered, each circuit carefully
specified and numbered, suppose we have a fully illustrated instruction
manual, that we have videos illustrating how to assemble each of its
parts, and that we have all the necessary tools to assemble each part
and the tools needed to put it back together. Do you think that you
would need additional help to put it together? Could you put it together
by yourself? How long would it take you to do it?</p>
<p>What would happen if you do not have the numbering of the pieces and
the circuits but you have everything else? Could you still put it
together? And if you didn't have the instructions? And without the
videos? Could you still build it? And without the tools? What if the
pieces were not in the same place, but scattered all over the planet?
Could you still put it together? What if you had to build the pieces
from the elements of the periodic table? What if as time passes the
pieces that already put together tend to fall apart, or rust, or get
damaged, or just get old? What if the only thing you can do to make a
decision for building a piece is tossing a coin to see if it comes out
heads or tails? What if you, the one who puts it together, have no
intelligence, no will, no creativity, neither the ability to make
decisions? COULD YOU STILL BUILD IT?</p>
<p>Because more or less that is what they teach us in school that
happened with machines that we don't even understand how they work. All
the biological machinery.</p>
<p>Remember that we are only trying to put together a car for common use
by human beings. That which we DO understand how it works. In the case
of assembling a human being we are talking about an organism that in the
vast majority of its factories, of its cells, it has all the information
on how build the whole organism. That the whole organism came out of a
single factory, a single cell, a fertilized egg. That these cells can
take on different functions, contextures, to form parts of each of the
systems. Digestive, endocrine, immune system, circulatory, nervous,
bone, muscular, respiratory, etc. A system that also presents
consciousness, intelligence, creativity, ability to create automobiles
to use as a means of transportation. A machine so complex that we do not
even understand how to build the most elementary of its parts: the
cell.</p>
<p>In the story that they tell us at school, not only that common use
car was put together with a lot of time and pure luck, but also the one
that created that car was put together the same way.</p>
<p>The field of study called abiogenesis is now the one in charge of
giving a so called scientific touch to that tale.</p>
<h3 id="monomers_DOT_"><span id="anchor-190"></span>Monomers.</h3>
<p>Monomers are the letters and pieces of biological systems.</p>
<p>The person who intends to explain the process by which life can arise
from matter, without the existence of a creator, has to explain how to
form organic compounds from the periodic table. It is the minimum.</p>
<p>If an intelligent, designer and creative being as the human being
likes to call himself cannot chemically synthesize an organic compound
from the periodic table, if such an intelligent designer and creative
being cannot BUILD what was supposedly formed “SPONTANEOUSLY”, word that
those people who claim such an explanation love to repeat, much less it
can arise “magically”, sorry I meant "spontaneously", said organic
compound.</p>
<p>Abiogenesis is the field of study that aims to explain the origin of
life from lifeless matter.</p>
<p>One of the goals of abiogenesis is to explain the process, BEFORE the
existence of biochemistry, BEFORE the existence of organic compounds,
through which said organic compounds were formed, starting from the
elements of the periodic table.</p>
<p>Another of the objectives of abiogenesis is to explain how to build,
how synthesize, how to put together, how to assemble, a cell.</p>
<h4 id="the-letters_DOT_"><span id="anchor-191"></span>The letters.</h4>
<p>The simplest organic compounds, necessary and present in all
biological systems, those that are absolutely necessary to start
building a living cell, are 4 types of fundamental monomers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>monosaccharides,</li>
<li>amino acids,</li>
<li>the nucleotides and</li>
<li>glycerol.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the parts of the machines, and the letters of the programs,
that allow cells to be assembled.</p>
<p>The machines and programs needed to build a cell are basically 4
types of polymers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Carbohydrates,</li>
<li>Peptides,</li>
<li>Nucleic acids, and</li>
<li>Lipids.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these polymers are assembled from monomers. “Poly” means
many. “Mono” means one. A “Poly” is built of several “Monos”. A “many”
is made up of several “ones”. Easy right?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Carbohydrates are made of monosaccharides.</li>
<li>Peptides or proteins are made from amino acids.</li>
<li>Nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides.</li>
<li>Lipids are made from glycerol.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="gloves_DOT_"><span id="anchor-192"></span>Gloves.</h4>
<p>You cannot put a left hand glove on your right hand. This is because
the mirror image of your left hand cannot be superimposed on your right
hand. When the structure of a chemical compound presents this
characteristic is said to be CHIRAL. And when in one sample of a
chemical compound there is only one type of chirality, that is all are
gloves for the right hand or all are gloves for the left, the sample is
said to be HOMOCHIRAL. When there are gloves for both the right and the
left mixed in the sample, it is said that the sample is racemic.</p>
<p>The monomers, those pieces and letters, those that are of 4 types:
monosaccharides, amino acids, nucleotides and glycerol, which are
observed in biological systems, they have that characteristic to be
HOMOCHIRAL in biological machinery. They are all gloves for the same
hand. The letters and the pieces with which the cell machines and
programs are assembled are all homochiral.</p>
<h4 id="reactions_DOT_"><span id="anchor-193"></span>Reactions.</h4>
<p>Each chemical reaction has different necessary conditions for
temperature, acidity, pressure, electromagnetic radiation, energy,
purity in the reagents, etc. so that it can actually happen.</p>
<p>Some reactions require the presence of specific compounds that
facilitate them although they do not participate in the reaction. They
need facilitators.</p>
<p>Some reactions need to be stopped because if they continue you will
not get the expected result. They need a change in conditions to stop
the reaction. They need a brake at the right time.</p>
<p>Some reactions result in a mixture of several compounds where only
one of them is the desired one and may be in a ratio very small compared
to the total result. It may happen that only 1% of the mixture is the
compound that is desired. And it is necessary to separate said desired
compound by some additional procedure that is sometimes simply not
known, it’s not known how to separate it from all the undesired ones,
from the trash. Garbage is not wanted.</p>
<p>Some reactions do not work in reverse. They only work one way.</p>
<p>Some reactions require certain parts of the reactant to be protected,
so that the reaction occurs only in the points, at the right places, of
the chemical structure, where it is desired. Something like putting on
shoes and a glove on your right hand so that the union with the other,
that desired link, is only by the left hand and not by any other
extremity. This implies preparation prior to the reaction of each of the
reactants. Sometimes it requires protection.</p>
<p>Once you have a reaction, you need to show that you actually got what
you wanted and in what quantities. This process is called
characterization. And many times it is even more complex than the
reaction itself.</p>
<h4 id="easy_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-194"></span>Easy.</h4>
<p>What happens then when, in the field of abiogenesis, it is intended
to explain how these letters and fundamental pieces were formed, those
first organic compounds that are monosaccharides, amino acids,
nucleotides and glycerol, on a DEAD and BRUTE planet where there was no
laboratories, and for my next step in my chain of chemical reactions I
need the result of my previous step to be in homochiral form, for it to
have the necessary purity, suitably protected for the following reaction
to occur, conveniently separated from other compounds, with the
conditions of temperature, pressure, acidity, etc. And the ongoing
reaction has not stopped, my desired compound is being mixed with 4
other garbage compounds and in a proportion less than 1% of the amount I
need, which I have no idea how to separate from the garbage compounds,
which is being formed in racemic form and not homochiral as I need it,
that my reaction has no reverse and even though I am in my modern
laboratory with all the technology that the intelligence, design and
creativity of the human being has been able to produce, I have no idea
how to make that compound that I can extract from already existing
biological systems by destructive procedures that we have managed to
develop?</p>
<p>Easy. First I cheat and extract it from existing biological systems,
those that I intend to demonstrate how they were formed, through the
destructive procedures that we have developed to extract these
compounds. Something like destroying a car to remove the tires that I
need, those that I think were put together by themselves in millions of
years.</p>
<p>Then, using other organic compounds also extracted from biological
systems, I protect it in the parts that need protection for my next
step. I do all the steps the same way. And finally I write an article
omitting those little details, like the need of a human controlling the
conditions of the reactions, and announcing that the goal has already
been achieved.</p>
<p>And this is just to show that you can, in a modern laboratory and
with human intervention, build the letters and pieces of the programs
and machines that we find in cells.</p>
<p>That is the truth of the lie, the cheating, and the deceit, of those
articles on abiogenesis.</p>
<h3 id="polymers_DOT_"><span id="anchor-195"></span>Polymers.</h3>
<p>Polymers are the machines and programs of biological systems. They
are made of monomers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Carbohydrates are made of monosaccharides.</li>
<li>Peptides or proteins are made from amino acids.</li>
<li>Nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides.</li>
<li>Lipids are made from glycerol.</li>
</ol>
<p>The human being is not capable of synthesizing the monomers that make
up the essential polymers to build a cell without using what is already
in living cells, in existing biological systems, those that he pretends
to show how they were formed.</p>
<p>But LET'S SUPPOSE, LET'S ACCEPT, LET'S BELIEVE that yes, that man can
already build monomers without using compounds extracted from biological
systems. Which can synthesize monosaccharides, amino acids, nucleotides
and glycerol. That is the least of the problems.</p>
<p>If men intend to deny the creator, the human being would have to at
least, using all his intelligence, design and creativity, using all his
technology, using modern laboratories, those that a DEAD and BRUTE
planet does not have, in which everything supposedly happened
SPONTANEOUSLY, develop chemical procedures that allow reproducing at
least the simplest polymers observed in biological systems. Polymers for
which the sequence is already known, without having to design them,
those with which a cell is built: carbohydrates, peptides, nucleic acids
and lipids. Of the simplest cell, the easiest of them all, the one he
wants, the one he chooses.</p>
<p>Men can not.</p>
<p>He has to cheat. He has to extract the machines and programs from the
existing biological systems for use in the synthesis of said polymers.
Those that he supposedly want to prove appeared in a DEAD and BRUTE
planet millions of years ago, just with time, luck and chemical
reactions that supposedly occur SPONTANEOUSLY but man can not even do
using his latest technology and using all his creativity, intelligence
and design.</p>
<p>With those letters and pieces that are monosaccharides, amino acids,
nucleotides and glycerol he should be able to assemble at least the
carbohydrates, peptides, nucleic acids, and lipids of the simplest cell
imaginable.</p>
<p>Men should be able to synthesize them. He should be able to
polymerize them. He can not. He has to cheat. And yet the popular
explanation, the one we read in the encyclopedia, is that they arose
SPONTANEOUSLY. Puff, by them selves .</p>
<p>The machines that man can create to join letters of a, quote and
quote, “biological program” are the size of a REFRIGERATOR and can only
join a maximum of 15 to 20 letters before they start having the same
problems, in their chemical reactions, that the human being has to
synthesize the monomers in any other modern lab.</p>
<p>The longest program that man can synthesize with his machines goes up
to about 20 letters. If you want longer chains, you have to use the
machines extracted from biological systems. You have to use
carbohydrates, peptides, nucleic acids destructively extracted from
biological systems.</p>
<p>In fact, he has to cheat even more, because let's remember that we're
accepting the cheating that said letters were extracted from biological
systems and adequately protected using organic compounds also extracted
from biological systems.</p>
<p>A biological program for a single cell has hundreds of thousands of
letters, and machines found in biological systems are so small in size
that hundreds of thousands of these machines can fit in a single
cell.</p>
<p>We are not even close to being able to synthesize the polymers needed
to build a cell. We can not even accepting as if we could what we can't
do: Synthesize the monomers.</p>
<p>We cannot even knowing the information that describes the structure
of these polymers. But supposedly a DEAD and BRUTE planet could.
Supposedly it all happened SPONTANEOUSLY millions of years ago. That is
what they teach at school and they repeat it at college. Poof. By
themselves.</p>
<h3 id="programmer_DOT_"><span id="anchor-196"></span>Programmer.</h3>
<p>The human being is not even capable of synthesizing essential
polymers similar to those needed to build a cell, without using what is
already there in living cells, in existing biological systems, those
that he aims to show how they were formed magically, sorry,
spontaneously in a DEAD and BRUTE planet.</p>
<p>But LET'S SUPPOSE, LET'S ACCEPT, LET'S BELIEVE that yes, that man can
already build, synthesize, polymers resembling those essential for
building a cell, without using compounds extracted from biological
systems. LET'S SUPPOSE that he can synthesize carbohydrates, peptides,
nucleic acids and lipids.</p>
<p>That is just the second challenge. That's just the power to
write.</p>
<p>The most important question of all is: What is he going to write?</p>
<p>Programs are not written by themselves. And much less randomly, by
chance, by luck. Some people think otherwise and try to prove so by
writing programs. Programs that didn't write themselves either. Absurd,
right? Programs that seek to be random using a MACHINE. Using something
completely deterministic like a computer. Even more absurd, right? Using
functions that pretend to be random, pseudo-random functions, “almost”
but “NOT” random.</p>
<p>The mathematical question of whether there is a fair coin, one that
is not preferential, a truly random function, one that is no longer
pseudo, that which is no longer quasi-random but that it IS random, it’s
considered an open problem. It is considered a problem that has not been
resolved. Neither for YES, nor for NO. It shouldn't be, because it's
equivalent to problems that HAVE been resolved. It doesn’t exist. Don't
look for it. There is a Creator.</p>
<p>But LET’S SUPPOSE, ACCEPT, BELIEVE, for the sake of argumentation,
that the human being uses any tool he wants, not necessarily organic
polymers, to write the program that he wants and how ever he wants
it.</p>
<p>The program that the human being should be able to write, using all
his intellectual capacity, creativity and design, that which does not
have the supposed DEAD and BRUTE planet in which supposedly everything
happened SPONTANEOUSLY, it would have be one who can at least do what he
himself, the human being, does. It should be able to simulate, mimic,
what a human brain does. The famous artificial intelligence. One who
passes the famous Turing test. One who learns to learn. One that
processes information in a way indistinguishable from the way a human
does it.</p>
<p>We have not been able.</p>
<p>But LET’S SUPPOSE, LET'S ACCEPT, LET'S BELIEVE, that yes, that the
human being has already achieved the creation of a program that
processes information in a manner indistinguishable from like a human
does it.</p>
<p>In that hypothetical case, in which you need to BELIEVE and SUPPOSE
more than what is needed to BELIEVE that Jesus Christ is alive because
he was resurrected, the ONLY thing that will have been shown is that to
create a REAL intelligence, ANOTHER one is needed.</p>
<p>The ONLY thing you would have shown is the need for a programmer, the
NEED of a CREATOR.</p>
<p>That Creator didn't just design the DNA program. DNA is just the
program. The machine on which it is going to be executed is also needed.
And said machine needs energy and the right environment so that it can
run the program. The fertilized egg needs the uterus.</p>
<p>This factory that is the fertilized ovum begins to subdivide
following the specific program and after nine months we have, only in
the brain, a program that we have no idea how it works. And we can't
even mimic it with our best technology.</p>
<p>But no, some people come to believe, because that is what they were
taught as children in school, that a DEAD and BRUTE planet turned out to
be more alive and intelligent than us. Absurd, right? But that's where
we are.</p>
<p>A person about 3 thousand years ago understood it better than many
modern scientists. Psalm 100 tells us:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>K</strong>now ye that the <strong>Lord
</strong>he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we
are his people, and the sheep of his pasture<strong>"
</strong><strong><a href="#fn704" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref704"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>704</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Dead in the deception of denying the Creator.</p>
<h3 id="the-tale-of-the-frog_DOT_"><span id="anchor-197"></span>The tale of
the frog.</h3>
<p>One of the most famous tales is that of the frog that becomes the
prince. It is a tale for children.</p>
<p>A similar tale, but adding millions of years, is that of evolution.
Man evolved from a reptile in millions of years.</p>
<p>Any method recognized as scientific must start from observable
evidence.</p>
<p>There is NO, ZERO, nothing, zip, NADA, nadita, nada, ni poquito, of
OBSERVABLE evidence that an animal kind, a feline, a canine, an equine,
transforms, evolves, changes over time into another kind.</p>
<p>In the examples of change that those who believe the tale, the animal
NEVER changes kind.</p>
<p>Bacteria are still bacteria, birds are still birds, turtles are still
turtles, fish are still fish, insects are still insects, canines are
still canines, equines are still equines and felines are still
felines.</p>
<p>And in the most modern examples that claim to show genetic changes,
it’s simply the same animal without a member, with the member impaired,
or with a member in the wrong place. And the similarities that are
alleged in the genetic code between chimps and humans are only in the
COMPARABLE sections and in the most similar cases of those COMPARABLE
parts, the similarities never exceed 85%, according to the proponents
themselves. Something like arguing that if the leg of a monkey
resembles, in COMPARABLE parts, that of a man in 85%, it is evidence
that both have a common ancestor. Your host believes that the accepted
maximum of 85% is not even 60% in reality. The explanation is that they
are DIFFERENT kinds of creatures. They are different designs with some
common functionality.</p>
<p>It is portrayed as evidence some fossils of bones, that supposedly
have been there millions of years, but that let’s remember they have
Carbon 14, that Carbon 14 that supposedly can't be there if something
died more than 60 thousand years ago, and with those stones they put
together a story of the imagination that lasts millions of years.</p>
<p>It is impossible to OBSERVE the CHANGE, that which is required by any
method that is considered as scientific. It is impossible to observe
because supposedly it happened millions of years ago and it is not
possible to reproduce it in ANY laboratory because the CHANGE supposedly
also occurs in millions of years.</p>
<p>There is no OBSERVABLE evidence of a change from one kind of animal
to another.</p>
<p>The only thing that is observed is adaptation. That happens even
within the life span of a human being. But no one argues that a short
person is of different kind than a tall person. Only a person who
believes the tale of the frog would consider that a person with black
skin is of a different kind than a white-skinned one.</p>
<p>The modern classification according to species is completely
arbitrary, there are more than ten different definitions of the word,
and the only thing that it achieves is to differentiate the
ramifications of the ADAPTATION that has had the same kind of
animal.</p>
<p>Canines are still canines, equines are still equines, and felines are
still felines.</p>
<p>The supposed evolution of the species, the one that changes kind, the
one that they call macro-evolution, the one that supposedly was the
original, it can NOT be OBSERVED anywhere. It is an imaginary tale.
There is not OBSERVABLE evidence of kind change.</p>
<p>Bacteria are still bacteria, birds are still birds, turtles are still
turtles, fish are still fish, insects are still insects, canines are
still canines, equines are still equines and felines are still
felines.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it has been observed on multiple occasions that when
two of these ADAPTATIONS begin to coexist in the same environment for a
long period of time, say forty years, it is observed that they are able
to cross among them.</p>
<p>The large amount of genetic information that differs between two
different kinds of animals was never understood, during the last
century, as descriptive information of the kind of animal, and only
until recently it has been observed that it intervenes in the process of
gestation of the animal. It was considered junk DNA, once used during
those supposed millions of years for one kind of animal to evolve into
another. Evolution for which there is NO OBSERVABLE evidence, because it
supposedly happens in millions of years and supposedly it happened
millions of years ago, and that of course cannot be OBSERVED today. A
tale of man's imagination.</p>
<p>We were also taught in school that some organs, of which we did not
know their function, that are found in current biological systems, were
completely unnecessary and were there to remind us of those millions of
years of evolution. We were taught that of the appendix, only to come to
discover , a few years later, that it is part of the immune system. We
were taught that about the coccyx, only to come to discover, a few years
later, its function as termination and support of a multitude of
ligaments and muscles. We were taught that whales and other aquatic
animals have small bones that are vestiges of what once were a pelvis
and legs, only to come and discover, the important role they play in the
mating of these animals.</p>
<p>Perhaps, who knows, maybe, possibly, the people who believe the tale
of the frog should begin to consider the possibility that simply the
story NEVER HAPPENED. That the reason there is NO OBSERVABLE EVIDENCE of
transformation, of evolution, of CHANGE from one kind to another, it’s
not only that it tries to know the whole movie, of supposedly billions
of years, just by looking at the last picture, but that said
transformation NEVER HAPPENED. There was NEVER an evolution. They were
NOT thousands of millions of years. The movie lasts only a few thousands
years. And it began when the Creator decided so. And all kinds of
animals were physically created at the same time.</p>
<p>But no. They continue with tales to support a tale of a frog who
became prince. Only that it happens in millions of millions of years to
make it look believable.</p>
<p>Dead in the deception of denying the Creator.</p>
<h3 id="trees_DOT_"><span id="anchor-198"></span>Trees.</h3>
<p>Fossils of trees are found in geological strata in vertical position.
The same fossil crosses several layers or geological strata that
supposedly took millions of years to form.</p>
<p>The traditional explanation of how this happened is that for those,
and only for those trees, geological events that we see today, of quick
deposit or several small ones were the ones who buried said trees.
Examples of such events include volcanic deposits, deltaic deposits and
glacial deposits. That was a volcano, that was a river, that was a
glacial. That is to say that for those and only for those trees, the
geological strata formed quickly and not in millions of years. But yes,
not even by accident is it considered that the evidence is perfectly
consistent with a planetary flood event.</p>
<p>But what happens when not all tree fossils are in a head up
position?, when some are in a root up position?. What if the famous
Carbon 14 is found in these fossils? That Carbon 14 that supposedly
can't be there if a tree died and started to fossilize more than 60
thousand years ago?, what happens when this occurs in strata that was
already classified as being millions of years old?</p>
<p>Nothing happens, the evidence gets ignored. The evidence is simply as
if it did not exist. It is too contradictory even with the same
assumptions of what is called evidence.</p>
<p>The story of the frog that becomes a prince is still held, because
it’s the only alternative to admitting the existence of a Creator.</p>
<p>Dead in the deception of denying the Creator.</p>
<h3 id="coal_DOT_"><span id="anchor-199"></span>Coal.</h3>
<p>The explanation taught even in online encyclopedias is that the
formation of the carbon that we observe on the planet took millions of
years of plant debris that accumulated under water and clay. And that
said remains were buried by sediments, and then, supposedly over
millions of years of high pressures and temperatures produced by the
burial, they caused a loss of water, methane and carbon dioxide. And
this loss increased the proportion of carbon, and voila. Easy,
right?</p>
<p>But what happens when we find coal reserves of 26 thousand square
kilometers, with carbon bands, low in impurities and low in sulfur, 61
meters thick, hundreds of kilometers long, and almost 80 kilometers
wide? How to explain that, over millions of years, the necessary
conditions to form them were kept? Why did not the bands get diluted in
fluxes of clay or other impurities before thickening? What happens when
Carbon 14 is found inside that carbon?, that Carbon 14 that supposedly
cannot be there if something is more than 60 thousand years old? What
happens when oval radiation rings are found within the coal indicating a
rapid and simultaneous formation with the coal because these rings would
have dissipated, faded or cracked if the coal formation had taken
million years or it had not been simultaneous with the rings? What
happens when carbon is formed from wood in the presence of water,
absence of air, at 160 degrees centigrade, high pressures, and with only
two weeks or so of waiting?</p>
<p>Nothing. Absolutely nothing happens. The topic is ignored. The
evidence is just like if it did not exist. It is too contradictory even
with the same assumptions of what is called evidence.</p>
<p>The story of the frog that becomes a prince is still held, because it
is the only alternative to admitting the existence of a Creator.</p>

<h3 id="tectonics_DOT_"><span id="anchor-200"></span>Tectonics.</h3>
<p>A series of characteristics are observed on the planet in the land
and the ocean. Mountains, lakes, volcanoes on land and ocean, large
deposits of minerals and organic compounds, large canyons, oceanic
trenches, mid-ocean ridges, a granite crust covering partially the
planet, etc.</p>
<p>In the last century, seeking to explain what we observe and using too
much imagination the theory of tectonic plates was proposed. A theory
that proposes a series of mechanisms such as the expansion of the marine
floor, subduction, mountain building, mantle circulation, hotspots,
transform faults, inversion of magnetic poles of the planet, in short, a
whole series of mechanisms that NEVER, listen: NEVER, they have NEVER
been observed.</p>
<p>NONE of these supposed processes have EVER been measured. There is no
OBSERVABLE evidence that these processes happen.</p>
<p>The excuse is the same as the one in the tale of the frog, the one in
the tale of the macroevolution: is that they happen in hundreds of
millions of years.</p>
<p>Tectonic plate theory assumes too much, it imagines too much. It
happens to it the same thing as to all the other theories that use the
present to imagine, his followers call it "deduce", quote and quote, the
past.</p>
<p>With a picture, one frame, of the present, a movie of the past
billions of years is imagined.</p>
<p>There is NO OBSERVABLE evidence of the highly imaginative mechanisms
of billions of years that supposedly explain what we do observe in
today’s present. The picture of the present. These mechanisms are
supposedly deduced from the vivid imagination of those who claim
them.</p>
<p>That happens because when it comes to denying the Creator you have to
have a much larger imagination than is needed to believe that Jesus
Christ is alive because he was resurrected.</p>
<p>Do not confuse the plates that are IMAGINED with the crust of GRANITE
that IS observed and the terrestrial mantle of SILICATES that IS
observed.</p>
<p>The granite crust that we have been able to observe, which is known
as continental crust, corresponds to the dry land that we observe above
sea level and extends partially as a border in the oceans to what is
known as the “continental shelf”. The granite crust is on average 40 km
thick and is composed mainly of granite and sediments.</p>
<p>Not all of the Earth's mantle is covered by the granite crust, the
continental crust. In the oceans, parts of the mantle are only covered
by sediment and water. This layer is known as the layer 1 of the oceanic
crust and it actually includes in its layers 2 and 3 part of the earth's
mantle.</p>
<p>The mantle is an earth’s layer that we can OBSERVE, which is composed
of silicates, which is about 2900 kilometers thick, and which surrounds
the core, the center of the planet.</p>
<p>That is what we observe: a granite crust, layers of sediments and the
thickest layer of all, formed by silicates, which we call mantle. Not
even what we call the core of the planet has been directly observed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the supposed tectonic plates have an average of
125 km thick, almost 85 km on average, supposedly thicker than the
granite crust. These so-called plates are composed of crust continental,
oceanic crust and an arbitrary upper part of the terrestrial mantle,
each one decides how much it includes, or not, as part of each plate.
Make your tectonic plate game. That is, the thickness of the supposed
plates is formed by an arbitrary mixture of the observed earth’s layers,
clearly distinguished in their chemical composition, which we DO
observe.</p>
<p>The Earth's mantle is a layer of about 2900 kilometers thick of
silicate rock formations and each imagined tectonic plate supposedly has
in its innermost part about 85 km from the top of the mantle.</p>
<p>These plates do NOT correspond to the dry land that we observe above
sea level but with an arbitrary division that changes as much as the
division into continents change. Some admit more plates others admit
fewer plates.</p>
<p>In addition, the supposed plates penetrate the ocean much more than
the granite crust that we CAN observe until we reach the "oceanic
ridges”, which we can also observe, and that is where they imagine that
such tectonic plates are formed. That is, other completely arbitrary
borders, this time in the area covered by the supposed tectonic
plates.</p>
<p>Plate tectonics cannot be OBSERVED because the imagined processes
that would allow us to identify its borders, its edges, they supposedly
happen in hundreds of millions of years and we haven't been that long in
the planet.</p>
<p>With a picture of the present they imagine a movie of billions of
years of the past.</p>
<h4 id="trenches_DOT_"><span id="anchor-201"></span>Trenches.</h4>
<p>The vast majority of earth’s oceanic trenches are found in the
Pacific ocean. The imagination of man has proposed that these trenches
formed when one plate was pushed under another in a process that has
been called subduction. Subduction is the supposed mechanism that
explains the formation of the oceanic trenches of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Today's seismic tomography should show clear images in 3 dimensions
of gigantic plates that supposedly have an average thickness of 14 times
the height of mount Everest, about 125 kilometers in thickness,
penetrating one below the other in each zone, listen: IN EACH ZONE, NOT
in a single one that has been manipulated, where there is an oceanic
trench at the Pacific. They are not there. We imagine them.</p>
<p>A single zone, explainable by a global flood event, with images that
are by no means conclusive, they get manipulated to make it appear that
the conditions are met, and we generalize that the same thing happens in
ALL other zones where there SHOULD be clear three-dimensional seismic
tomography images of the supposed subductions that of course we do not
have.</p>
<p>If we really are able to measure a displacement of up to maximum 10
CENTIMETERS per year, carefully measured with technology which normally
has a margin of error of 15 METERS, that is to say a margin of error
almost 100 times BIGGER than what you want to measure, in the planet's
crust which is on average 15 kilometers thick, listen: on the CRUST, NOT
on some supposed plates that they want to make us believe that they
exist and that they are supposedly almost 10 times thicker than the
earth's crust, if we are really able to measure said displacement of the
crust, why are we not able to observe the supposed subduction of the
supposed plates? The excuse is the same always: it happens in hundreds
of millions of years. The people that they simply repeat the story they
were taught, as if they were parrots, they should consider the
possibility that it just doesn't happen.</p>
<p>But the story of the subduction, that a plate of 125 kilometers in
thickness, which does not correspond to observable characteristics but
to imagined ones, which penetrates under another of a similar thickness,
in addition presents other serious logical problems in explaining, as
claimed, the oceanic trenches of the Pacific that we DO observe.</p>
<p>What is the mechanism that makes the plates move? Which is the
driving force? Why is there NO movement or flow observed at all in the
mantle of the planet? If volcanoes occur under the plate superior by the
magma generated in the friction of the two plates when the supposed
subduction or penetration, how to explain that the volcanoes are on the
aquatic side of the trench and not on the side penetrated into the
land’s zone? How to explain that this supposed subduction occurs in an
arc shape? If the plates are supposedly being generated at the
mid-oceanic ridges that are supposedly rising, and the oceanic trenches
are supposedly generated by supposed penetrations of one plate below
another, how is it possible that there are intersections of trenches
with ridges? How is it possible that material is rising and falling at
the same time? What forces break plates supposedly between 50 and 200 km
in thickness so they get separated? What forces make one penetrate under
another? What forces make it possible to overcome the enormous pressures
that would be generated in opposition to the supposed plate that is
trying to penetrate? If one plate is penetrating under another and there
is a strong friction when doing it, how to explain that the layers of
sedimentation in the trenches are not disturbed? If ocean trenches are
produced by plate subduction, a process that would increase the mass
below the upper plate, how to explain the mass deficiencies below the
trenches?</p>
<p>The story has several logical problems.</p>
<p>But what happens with all the evidence to the contrary and the lack
of it in favour? And what happens with all the failed logic in the
assumed mechanisms? Nothing. Nothing happens. The topic is ignored. The
evidence and failed logic is as if they did not exist.</p>
<p>Dead in the deception of denying the Creator.</p>
<h3 id="ridges_DOT_"><span id="anchor-202"></span>Ridges.</h3>
<p>On the planet's oceans floor, a formation known as mid-oceanic ridge
is observed. It is the longest rock formation on the planet. It is a
huge and long scar that surrounds the entire planet similar to how seams
surround a baseball.</p>
<p>This rock formation is credited with the formation of the tectonic
plates. The problem is the same as always: there is NO OBSERVABLE
evidence. Everything happens sporadically in processes that supposedly
last hundreds of millions of years. Sporadic volcanic eruptions for
hundreds of millions of years. Supposedly for this reason we do not
observe how tectonic plates are formed.</p>
<p>What we DO observe is that in various parts of the formation there
are cracks in perpendicular directions. These cracks indicate tension
fracture, separation fracture, getting away fracture. This cracks are
observed in two perpendicular directions. Some perpendicular to the line
of the ridge and others parallel to the line of the ridge. The ones
parallel to line NEVER cross the ones perpendicular to the line. This
observation is completely contrary to the way in which mountains on the
surface are believed to form: by compression of material.</p>
<p>The evidence observed, these cracks, indicate that the ridges are
formed by tension fractures, NOT compression fractures, much less in TWO
perpendicular directions.</p>
<p>What does the theory of plate tectonics do with this evidence?
Nothing. It ignores it. Maybe because it can't explain it. It is not
even mentioned in famous Internet encyclopedias. But YES it can be seen
with the naked eye on any ocean relief map.</p>
<p>Below India, east of Africa, on an ocean relief map, a characteristic
of the planetary ridge is observed: There is a gigantic "Y" inverted,
forming a meeting in the form of a capital "T" letter. If the ridge is
supposedly generating the formation of tectonic plates, why don't we see
accumulation of ocean floor, as in a way of mountain formations by
compression, in the areas of the "T" where there would be generation
from two perpendicular directions? Other little problem of simple logic
for the "theory", quote and quote, of plate tectonics.</p>

<h4 id="another-story_DOT_"><span id="anchor-204"></span>Another story.</h4>
<p>In this story it must be recognized that the evidence and logic
indicate that there has to be a Creator.</p>
<p>This tale matches better with logic, with the evidence, and with the
testimony of the 6th chapter of the book of genesis about an event that
marked the history of humanity: a global planetary flood.</p>
<p>Just look at a photo of the planet from space and see that it seems
flooded with water to recognize that, just there, this story already
matches better with logic, evidence, and the bible.</p>
<p>But it's still just another story. There is no technical creativity.
It is not something that the human being can rebuild.</p>
<p>The following presentation is based on the theory of hydroplates or
“hydroplate theory”, initially proposed by Walt Brown in 1980 and last
revised in 2019. Dr Brown may be called doctor because he has a PhD in
mechanical engineering from MIT. His complete presentation is in a book

<p>Your host, that is, me, Jose Luis Quiroga, does not share the theory
of hydroplates in its entirety, not even in all the biblical foundation.
But, in everything related to planetary geology, it seems to me that is
simply the most logical and coherent explanation, with all the evidence,
including the bible, that exists so far for what we see today on the
planet.</p>
<h4 id="conditions_DOT_"><span id="anchor-205"></span>Conditions.</h4>
<p>The hydroplate theory starts from only 2 initial conditions for
explaining more than 15 geological and planetary features that we
observe today, and that, in the light, pardon me, the darkness, of the
most popular explanations seem contradictory.</p>
<p>The two initial conditions are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Subterranean water.</li>
<li>Global granite shell.</li>
</ol>
<p>This planet had a global shell of granite that covered it completely
and had, under the shell, water stored in underground chambers. There
were no great oceans or great mountains. The planet did not seem flooded
in water. The surface water was a few hundred meters deep and the
highest parts of the mainland were also a few hundred meters high. The
granite shell was a few tens of kilometers thick. The height of the
underground chambers that contained the water between the granite shell
and the center of the planet was only a couple of kilometers.</p>
<h4 id="the-process_DOT_"><span id="anchor-206"></span>The process.</h4>
<p>That great shell of granite that covered the entire planet and that
had under it super-critical water increasing in pressure every time the
earth rotated on its axis, it broke and tore, due to the pressure of
that super-critical water, just above the formation that today we call
mid-oceanic ridge and that divides the planet into two large parts as do
the seams of a baseball. All the continents we see today are the torn
and shrunken pieces of what was that granite shell. As this shell burst
and tore, it contracted, shifted and shrunk slightly, releasing all the
water inside it, and since it was lubricated by the water that was
escaping from its interior, moved in the direction of contraction. The
internal instability in the planet generated by that tear slightly
bulged the planet in the Atlantic and submerged it slightly in the
Pacific. The wrinkles on the granite shell changed the surface mass
distribution of the planet and this, by conservation of angular
momentum, caused a latitude rotation on the planet and what was near the
equator of the planet is now the north pole. The end result of this
process is what we see today. The rupture phase lasted for hours, then
the flooding lasted for months, then the drift phase lasted days and
finally the recovery phase is not over yet.</p>
<h4 id="in-two_DOT_"><span id="anchor-207"></span>In two.</h4>
<p>The mid-ocean ridge splits the planet in two.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A part includes half of what we now know as North pole, all the
current Americas, all the current South Pole and the southern part of
the Indian Ocean to the tip of the inverted "Y" of the ridge that is
south of present-day India.</li>
<li>The other part includes the rest: Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia,
almost all of the Pacific Ocean and the northern part of the Indian
Ocean.</li>
</ol>
<p>To the part of the granite shell that now contains the Americas will
be called from now on the Atlantic hydroplate and the other part of the
granite shell, the largest in area, it will be called the Pacific
hydroplate.</p>
<p>The Pacific hydroplate covered almost 3 quarters of the planet while
the Atlantic hydroplate only 1 quarter of the planet. The two large
hydroplates into which the granite shell that covered the planet was
divided were lubricated by the underground water. Hence the name of the
theory. Hydroplate theory.</p>
<h4 id="a-comparison_DOT_"><span id="anchor-208"></span>A comparison.</h4>
<p>Imagine a ball the size of an apple with a waterproof cloth that
covers it. The cloth is the same thickness as the apple peel, and
between the ball and the cloth there is a lubricant. The ball is the
planet, the cloth is the granite shell, and the lubricant is the muddy
water in super-critical state.</p>
<p>When the cloth covering the ball is torn along a line with the same
shape of the mid-ocean ridge, the cloth slides over the surface of the
ball letting the lubricant escape and contracts forming what we now call
continents.</p>
<p>At the same time that this is happening, the ball deforms slightly in
a tenth of the thickness of the cloth. On one side of the ball bulges
into a tenth of the thickness of the cloth and by the opposite side
sinks to a similar thickness. The edge of the sank zone would be pacific
trenches.</p>
<p>When the cloth shrinks and shifts, the cloth will wrinkle slightly on
some parts of its surface, not more than one-tenth of the thickness of
the cloth. The wrinkles would be the mountains.</p>
<p>The escaping lubricant ends up largely over the cloth that covered
it. That water would be the oceans. At first glance it only seems that
the cloth tore and shrank and that the liquid escaped and covered good
part of the ball.</p>
<p>The wrinkles, that is to say the mountains, and the depressions, that
is to say the zone limited by the trenches, are difficult to perceive
with the naked eye in the ball of the size of an apple because they only
have a maximum height of one tenth of the thickness of the cloth that
covered the ball and which would be the thickness of the apple peel.</p>
<p>This comparison only gives us an idea of what happened to the cloth
and with the lubricant, that is to say with the granite shell and with
the super-critical water that was in the underground chambers, the two
initial conditions of the hydroplate theory.</p>
<p>Let's see a little more in detail how the whole process works.</p>
<h4 id="rupture-phase_DOT_"><span id="anchor-209"></span>Rupture Phase.</h4>
<h5 id="water_DOT_"><span id="anchor-210"></span>Water.</h5>
<p>For a few hundred years, the water that was in underground chambers
beneath the granite shell that completely covered the planet was heating
up and increasing pressure due to the daily rotation of the planet and
the presence of the moon until reaching the state known as super-fluid
or super-critical. State in which the matter is neither gas nor liquid
but super-fluid, also called supercritical.</p>
<p>The increase in pressure and temperature of the super-critical water
contained in the underground chambers made the ceiling of granite and
the floor of silicates from the chambers begin to dissolve in the super
critical water. A couple of kilometers from the granite shell was
dissolved in a few hundred years by the super-critical water and this
weakened the granite shell.</p>
<p>The pressure reached such a point that a crack opened on the surface
of the granite shell that grew horizontally and vertically, it also
deepened. First it ended up traveling horizontally around the planet in
a matter of a few hours, above what is now seen as the mid-ocean ridge.
The crack in the granite shell opened like stretched fabric that begins
to tear.</p>
<p>When the crack reached the depth of the underground chambers, the
super-critical water stored under the shell began to leak out fired by
said crack at super-sonic speeds releasing a stored energy greater than
ten billion hydrogen bombs and reaching heights of tens of kilometers
into the atmosphere. The majority of that water is what we now observe
as oceans.</p>
<p>Water in a superfluid state released at supersonic speeds underwent a
chain reaction by the energy stored on the surface of the microscopic
droplets and in the ions of the super-fluid. The heat released was
almost entirely used in the union of the ions and almost instantaneously
on the vaporization of existing droplets or resulting from the union of
ions producing an incremental expansion in vapor form at supersonic
speeds as the super-fluid was released.</p>
<p>The super-fluid jet and its vertically directed expansion that should
have been observed can be imagined by observing the jets of steam
released on Saturn's moon Enceladus and on Jupiter's moon Europa. Since
the energy released in this cataclysm was much greater than the that
released on these moons, the jet would have been along the entire the
crack, at much higher heights and speeds, much more focused, and without
so much dispersion of the super-fluid that escapes through the crack,
comparing with what is observed in these moons.</p>
<p>In the same way that the tip of a metal cutting torch focuses, the
gas released in a directed jet of gas, the jet of super-critical water
released was focused vertically into outer space by the crack in the
granite shell that formed just above what is now known as the mid-ocean
ridge.</p>
<p>The ridge was the floor of the underground chamber below the crack
and it simply marks the point where the granite shell gave way due to
the high pressure and the crack opened. At this time the floor had not
raised yet and the ridge did not exist yet.</p>
<h5 id="objects_DOT_"><span id="anchor-211"></span>Objects.</h5>
<p>A good part of the material that was shot vertically with the
super-critical water escaped into outer space and because they had
approximately the same vector velocity, that is, its velocity was
roughly the same in both magnitude and direction, that material was
gathered by the simple action of gravity in many of the objects that
today we call asteroids, meteorites, comets and trans-neptunian
objects.</p>
<h4 id="flood-phase_DOT_"><span id="anchor-212"></span>Flood Phase.</h4>
<p>Another part of the super-critical water that shot out did not come
out of the atmosphere but produced rains as abundant as the planet had
never experienced until then and has never experienced since. Part of
that super-critical water froze due to the lower temperatures of the
higher layers of the atmosphere and produced abundant hail rain.</p>
<h5 id="hail_DOT_"><span id="anchor-213"></span>Hail.</h5>
<p>All the material that had been diluted from the ceiling of the
underground chambers was expelled along with the super-critical water
and fell on the planet in the form of muddy rain or icy muddy hail.</p>
<p>Where hailstorms occurred, an effect was produced that today we
identify with ice ages. Actually it was just one and the effects have
been preserved in some parts due to the rotation of latitude that the
planet suffered. All evidence of frozen plants and animals near the
North pole indicates that they were from the tropics and that they were
frozen very quickly. This evidence is consistent with what would happen
if, a few months after being buried under hail, the planet underwent a
rotation of latitude that puts a tropical zone in the North Pole.</p>
<h5 id="discharges_DOT_"><span id="anchor-214"></span>Discharges.</h5>
<p>The high pressures, with which the super critical water was shot out
through the crack, they were widening, eroding, wearing away, the crack,
the opening, through which the water escaped, to such an extent that it
lost pressure and the rains stopped. But the water level on the planet
kept going up because muddy water kept escaping from the underground
chambers that were under the granite shell.</p>
<p>As the super-critical water escaped the opening widened and to the
granite shell a similar effect, only much slower, to what happens with
the tongue when saying “BRRRRRRRRR” was produced: the tongue vibrates or
flaps. This flutter effect, or waves of the hydroplates, of vertical
pulsation, made the jet of water that came out through what was just a
crack, already turned into an opening, to also pulsate.</p>
<p>This undulation in the Atlantic and Pacific hydroplates produced a
piezoelectric effect inside the hydroplates that generated large
discharges of energy. Discharges similar to what happens when we see a
lightning fall from the sky. These lightnings or discharges of
electrical energy occurred between the surface and the bottom of the
gigantic granite hydroplates. The z-pinch effect that happened in these
internal discharges of what we now call continental crust, that which
was the original granite shell, produced a nuclear fission effect in the
atoms used in the plasmatic zone of each discharge, and this produced
heavy elements that began to decay into the radioactive elements that we
observe today mainly in said continental crust.</p>
<h5 id="strata_DOT_"><span id="anchor-215"></span>Strata.</h5>
<p>The muddy water began to sat on top of the granite shell by the
action of slow waves of about 60 meters high, both from the water above
these, as of the granite shell itself on which they were starting to
sit, to sediment. The liquefaction of these sediments, together with
this undulation, they were separating the sediments in different layers
with repetitive patterns. These layers were not necessarily in order of
size, shape, and density because not all sediments fell at the same
time.</p>
<p>The torrential rains lasted 40 days and the water continued to pour
out of underground chambers for another 110 days. During all this time
these layers were produced. These layers of sediment that came from the
roof of the underground chambers that stored the super-critical water,
that which was the bottom of the granite shell, is what we now know as
geological strata.</p>
<p>The water transported the material of the walls of the underground
chambers that was diluted in said water for hundreds of years before the
crack was formed through which the water escaped. This water, with said
materials diluted in it, moved, from under the granite shell, to above
the shell, as said water was escaping from the underground chambers
through the crack, later converted into an opening. By the process known
as liquefaction, these materials together with the biological remains of
what died on the surface, they settled down, they sedimented, forming
what is now known as geological strata.</p>
<p>Not all geological strata were formed at this time, but most of the
non-biological material comes from the ceiling of these underground
chambers. All that we call sedimentary rock.</p>
<h4 id="drift-phase_DOT_"><span id="anchor-216"></span>Drift Phase.</h4>
<h5 id="ridge_DOT_"><span id="anchor-217"></span>Ridge.</h5>
<p>When the rains stopped, the water continued to flow for several
months and because the crack widened so much that the water pressure
decreased, the downward pressure on the floor of the chambers under the
crack also decreased. This decrease in pressure on the floor of the
underground chambers made for the floor to rise. It was first raised
parallel to the crack in the granite shell. Then, as the crack in the
granite was widening, the floor under the crack was lifting in a
direction perpendicular to the crack in the granite. This lifting
produced cracks in the floor perpendicular to the lines of the lifts.
First floor cracks perpendicular to the granite crack and then floor
cracks parallel to the granite crack. This is the reason for which the
cracks in the mid-ocean ridge, that which was the floor of underground
chambers, have the characteristic that those that are parallel to the
ridge never cross the perpendicular ones. The perpendicular to the ridge
were formed first and then those parallel to the mid-ocean ridge. This
process generated what we now know as the mid-oceanic ridge.</p>
<h5 id="magnetic_DOT_"><span id="anchor-218"></span>Magnetic.</h5>
<p>The floor cracks parallel to the mid-ocean ridge make the
subterranean temperature of the ridge below said cracks smaller than
those in the areas where there is no crack. Since the magnetic capacity
of chemical elements depends on the temperature, the intensity of the
magnetism is greater where the temperature is lower. That's why the
magnetism is greater just above where the cracks are.</p>
<p>This curve of intensity of magnetism that corresponds perfectly with
the underground temperature is the one that has been misunderstood in
the popular tale by saying that in the past there were polarity
reversals at the magnetic poles of the planet. They never happened. We
just have to accurately interpret the evidence.</p>
<h5 id="separated_DOT_"><span id="anchor-219"></span>Separated.</h5>
<p>Since the hydroplates in which the granite shell split apart were
lubricated by the underground water, and due to the strong flow of
super-critical water, the two gigantic hydroplates were at the drift.
They kept afloat by the pressure of the water trying to get out only by
the rupture zone, just above the current mid-ocean ridge.</p>
<p>This movement of the gigantic hydroplates lasted until the pressure
of the water that came out of the underground chambers diminished enough
so that the ceiling of the chambers began to rub against the floor of
the chambers. This friction generated large amounts of magma and the
movement of the hydroplates began to stop.</p>
<h4 id="recovery-phase_DOT_"><span id="anchor-220"></span>Recovery
Phase.</h4>
<h5 id="magma_DOT_"><span id="anchor-221"></span>Magma.</h5>
<p>The imbalance in the pressures on the earth’s mantle product of the
uplifts in the mid-ocean ridge and the displacement of the hydroplates
generated small vertical cuts, internally in the planet's mantle, and
their walls rubbed each other as a result of that vertical displacement
of the planet’s surface and of the mantle below them.</p>
<p>These vertical cuts increased in quantity to the sides and to the
inside the planet as the ridge formed, as it lifted up, and as the area
around the ridge also went lifting up. That friction produced heat and
that heat made the material to melt into magma in these vertical
micro-cuts. This produced a cycle that accelerated the process. The
magma lubricated the micro cuts, these grew, this facilitated more
vertical movement, more friction, more heat, more magma, more
lubrication. In this way they generated gigantic columns of earth’s
mantle, below the ridge, separated by thin cracks lubricated with magma.
These columns go almost from the depth that the underground chambers
were to the depth of liquid zone of the planet's core.</p>
<h5 id="earthquakes_DOT_"><span id="anchor-222"></span>Earthquakes.</h5>
<p>Magma is much more compressible than the mantle, and below the
crossover depth, where the pressure is high enough, that is about 350
kilometers, the magma was compressed, became denser and sank toward the
core of the planet.</p>
<p>Above the crossover depth the magma expanded and came out to the
surface.</p>
<p>This type of movement of the magma is the cause of what even today we
observe and call seismic movements.</p>
<p>Currently at depths near the crossover depth there is almost no magma
movements. This is the reason why there are hardly any perceived seismic
movements whose epicenter is close to the depth of the 350 kilometers.
At this depth there are almost no magma displacements. The vast majority
of magma displacements occur near the surface. And a minority occur near
the liquid zone of the planetary core.</p>
<p>The increase in mass of compressed magma in the planet's core
continues today and this increase has caused the planet to be losing
volume. Similar to what is observed when a dry fruit loses volume.</p>
<p>The flow of magma towards the center and the surface of the planet
continues today and is the cause of the seismic movements of the
planet.</p>
<h5 id="field_DOT_"><span id="anchor-223"></span>Field.</h5>
<p>The increase of compressed magma in the liquid zone of the planet's
core caused the magnetic material in the displaced liquid crystals to be
realigned with the planet’s magnetic field and this is the reason why
the magnetic field of this planet is much stronger than that of the rest
of the solid planets in the solar system.</p>
<p>This alignment of magnetic elements that moved towards the nucleus
with the pre-existing field increased the field.</p>
<p>The crystallization of these magnetic elements, mainly iron and
nickel, generated a solid center on the planet. The solid zone of the
planet’s core .</p>
<h5 id="bulging-and-sinking_DOT_"><span id="anchor-224"></span>Bulging and
Sinking.</h5>
<p>The movement of the magma fed back: more vertical movement, more
friction, more heat, more magma, more lubrication and more vertical
movement.</p>
<p>The internal imbalance of the planet increased. A part of the planet
bulge and the opposite part sank.</p>
<p>The part that bulged is in what we now know as the Atlantic ocean and
the part that sank is in the area inside what we now know as the Pacific
ocean ring of fire. The magma that came out to the surface formed the
more than 40 thousand oceanic volcanoes that can be seen in the
Pacific.</p>
<p>This analysis allows to make one of the most important predictions of
hydroplate theory that has not been verified: In the area within the
gigantic "u" formed by the ring of fire, inside that "u", under the
floor of that area that is all sunk in the Pacific ocean, below the
floor of the layer of volcanic formations that are in that area, and
bordering the entire interior of that "u" that forms the ring of fire,
THERE SHOULD BE two large submerged pieces of the GRANITE hydroplates
that separated just above the mid-oceanic ridge of the Pacific.</p>
<h5 id="trenches_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-225"></span>Trenches.</h5>
<p>When the surface in the Pacific sank, a part of the gigantic
hydroplate of the Pacific also sank, it sank with the surface of the
planet, in the western part of the gigantic "u" of the Pacific ocean
that today we known as "the ring of fire", bordering the coasts of Asia
and Oceania.</p>
<p>And, when it sank, a part of the gigantic hydroplate of the Atlantic
sank, it sank with the surface of the planet, in the east part of said
"ring of fire", bordering the coasts of the Americas.</p>
<p>These sinking is what we observe as oceanic trenches in said ring of
fire.</p>
<h5 id="mountains_DOT_"><span id="anchor-226"></span>Mountains. </h5>
<p>When the friction between the ceiling and the floor of the
underground chambers stopped the movement of the gigantic hydroplates,
in some parts the hydroplates rose, wrinkled, producing the mountains we
see today. By that time they were in a state of liquefaction and behaved
as a dense fluid.</p>
<h5 id="unconformities_DOT_"><span
id="anchor-227"></span>Unconformities.</h5>
<p>In some areas of the planet, where there were wrinkles in the
hydroplates of granite low enough to still be completely covered with
water, the sediments that were on the high points of the wrinkles were
re-ordered by the waves in the water since they did not find support on
the granite hydroplate.</p>
<p>Due to the difference in densities between layer and layer, the
biologic remains of plants and animals slid uphill where the pressure
was lower, and they reorganized into new horizontal layers above the
previous layers of strata that had already settled, forming the breaking
zone in the geological strata that is now known as geological
unconformities.</p>
<h5 id="hydrocarbons_DOT_"><span id="anchor-228"></span>Hydrocarbons.</h5>
<p>The biological material that was separated in the middle of these
upper layers of sedimentation was compressed by the wrinkling of the
hydroplates and later by the weight of the upper layers and it reached
high temperatures. Depending on the amount of water, the pressure
reached, and the temperature reached, they formed the deposits of coal,
oil and gas that we see today.</p>
<p>The gigantic hydrocarbon deposits that cannot be explained if formed
over millions of years, because it would be impossible maintain the
necessary conditions in such large blocks for such a long time, they
find a completely feasible explanation under a process that lasted only
a few months and that can be reproduced today, in its chemical aspect,
in the laboratory.</p>
<h5 id="canyons_DOT_"><span id="anchor-229"></span>Canyons.</h5>
<p>The formation of mountains caused that part of the water that was
above the hydroplates to be trapped in some parts thus forming gigantic
lakes above the hydroplates. Seismic movements produced by the movement
of magma on the planet both towards the surface and towards the core of
the planet caused some lakes to overflow slightly producing a chain
effect of that overflow in which the flow of water increases the size of
the point of overflow until producing a gigantic outlet through which
the water of the lake comes out until it's almost empty.</p>
<p>This process was what generated, in a few weeks, great canyons like
the one found in Colorado.</p>
<p>The water that came out of these lakes sought the path of least
resistance and as it flowed out it took with it some of the land around
it and scratched, carved, in the ground the kind of patterns that are
observed in those canyons.</p>
<h5 id="plateaus_DOT_"><span id="anchor-230"></span>Plateaus.</h5>
<p>The friction between the ceiling and the floor of the underground
chambers, that were almost without water, it not only stopped the
movement of hydroplates and wrinkled them, forming today's mountains,
but generated large amounts of magma where the ceiling and floor of the
chambers touched.</p>
<p>When the weight of the granite hydroplates where there was more mass,
which is to say where the mountains formed, began to sink due to the
weight, the magma moved to the underground parts of the chambers where
there was less weight above, less pressure, that is to say where there
were no mountains above.</p>
<p>As magma accumulates under these flat areas, the upward pressure made
by the magma fractured the granite hydroplate and the cracks of those
fractures filled with magma allowing the magma to escape from the
underground chambers to the surface of the hydroplates.</p>
<p>This magma lubrication allowed hydroplate blocks to rise as a piston
rises. The rise of this hydroplate blocks due to the pressure made by
the magma that was escaping from below the hydroplate blocks trough
their perimeters, lubricating the rise of these blocks as a piston,
generated the plateaus that are observed beside some large and heavy
mountain areas.</p>
<h5 id="butte_DOT_"><span id="anchor-231"></span>Butte.</h5>
<p>The same uplift that generated the plateaus is also part of what
generated the overflow of lakes that had formed when the water was
surrounded by mountains and that generated canyons such as the one in
Colorado Arizona. And in cases where afterwards, the water that
overflowed from a lake, flowed around the solidified magma in volcanic
rock of these plateaus, eroding the sediments around the volcanic rock,
it formed the so-called Butte. Mountain formations of the plateau type
having solid magma or volcanic rock on top as in the case of the Red
Butte in the United States.</p>
<h5 id="latitude-rotation_DOT_"><span id="anchor-232"></span>Latitude
rotation.</h5>
<p>After the formation of the mountains, that wrinkling of the
hydroplates, and due to conservation of angular momentum, the zones of
high latitudes in which great mountains were formed began to move to
more southern latitudes and the planet suffered a latitude rotation.
Today's north pole was once in the tropical zone. Evidence for this
latitude rotation is found in the angular variation of the polarization
of the magma magnetic material that was solidifying as the magma cooled
when the planet rotated, thus leaving a record of said rotation.</p>
<h5 id="meridian-90_DOT_"><span id="anchor-233"></span>Meridian 90.</h5>
<p>The oceanic formation known as "the ridge of the meridian 90 East",
which is located just below the area with the highest mountains in the
planet, is another evidence that is observed today and that is explained
by the latitude rotation suffered by the planet. Since the planet is not
perfectly spherical but is more bulky in the equator, as the planet
rotated in latitude, the area that reached to the equator was stretched
with the tension generated by the daily turn of the planet, and in the
same way that a round rubber breaks in a single point when stretched
enough, the surface of the planet was always tearing by the same point
and as the magma generated in the crack was coming out it was
solidifying on the surface, thus generating said mountainous formation
in what is now the Indian ocean. That's the reason why it's almost a
straight line. It simply indicates the direction in which the planet
rotated. And the length of the formation tells us how much the planet
rotated, the angle that the planet rotated.</p>
<h5 id="continues_DOT_"><span id="anchor-234"></span>Continues.</h5>
<p>The recovery phase continues today. We still have growth in the
nucleus product of displacement of magma towards said nucleus. This
produces some of the seismic movements that we observe today. The other
earthquakes are the product of displacement of magma towards the surface
also producing the volcanic activity that we observe today. The slight
bulge at the Atlantic and slight sinking at the Pacific in the central
zone of the ring of fire continues today and that is why a small
displacement is observed in the continental crusts that is directed
towards that area of the Pacific. And the oceans and frozen poles of the
planet are planetary flood effects that we still see today.</p>
<h4 id="differences_DOT_"><span id="anchor-235"></span>Differences.</h4>
<p>Your host, that is me, Jose Luis Quiroga, has some differences with
the presentation of the hydroplate theory that Walt Brown does in his
book “In the Beginning” and with Brian Nickel’s Internet videos, a
contributor to the Center for Scientific Creation, the organization that
maintains creationscience.com.</p>
<p>One big difference is in what Genesis 1 and 2 includes as part of
THIS creation. This should be obvious to anyone who has not skipped the
section of this presentation dedicated to creation, and that has read Dr
Walt Brown's book, “In the Beginning”.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the hydroplate theory has more to do with what happened
during the planetary flood in Noah's time than with what happened during
creation.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is in the biblical justification for the
initial conditions of the hydroplate theory.</p>
<p>It is completely incoherent to think that the word H8064 <a
href="#fn705" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref705"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>705</sup></a> stops meaning the heavens,
shamaim, that in which according to Genesis 1 the birds fly, just for
one single verse of the bible: the one that says that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>A</strong><strong>nd God called the
firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second
day”</strong></strong> <a href="#fn706" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref706" role="doc-noteref"><sup>706</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Trying to give various meanings to the word H8064 <a href="#fn707"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref707"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>707</sup></a>, the shamaim, the heavens, in the
first chapter of the bible, to then choose the one I like best to fit
the two main assumptions of my story, however logical and consistent
with current evidence, is theologically untenable.</p>
<p>The bible says that: <strong><strong>"And God made the firmament, and
divided the waters which were UNDER the firmament from the waters which
were ABOVE the firmament: and it was so”</strong></strong> <a
href="#fn708" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref708"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>708</sup></a>. And then <strong><strong>“God
called the firmament HEAVEN”</strong></strong> <a href="#fn709"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref709"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>709</sup></a>. The same word, actually heavens,
the word H8064 <a href="#fn710" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref710"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>710</sup></a>, plural, shamaim, is used along
the whole first two chapters consistently to refer to a place where the
sun, the moon and the stars are observed, and the place where birds
fly.</p>
<p>But no, only when God decided to call the expansion "heavens", which
this theory wants to understand as the granite shell, is that it does
not mean what it always means, because obviously the heavens cannot be a
granite shell.</p>
<p>The bible is also very clear in saying that God said: <strong>"Let
the waters UNDER the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let
the DRY land appear: and it was so”</strong> <a href="#fn711"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref711"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>711</sup></a>. That dry land is the granite
shell. That dry land came out of the waters that were UNDER the expanse.
That dry land was formed UNDER the heavens. That dry land, which is the
granite shell, is UNDER the heavens. That dry land is NOT the
heavens.</p>
<p>It is perfectly possible that it is precisely this verse that gives
support to the two initial conditions of the hydroplate theory. It says:
<strong>"Let the waters UNDER the heaven be gathered together unto one
place, and let the DRY land appear: and it was so”</strong> <a
href="#fn712" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref712"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>712</sup></a>. When the dry land appeared, from
the waters that were UNDER the heavens, said waters that were gathered
in ONE place, as the book likes to emphasize, they also formed the seas,
plural, some in the underground chambers, others on the surface. The
“gathering”, quote and quote, is BEFORE the appearing of the land. And
the word H6960 behind that “gathering” is different to the word H4723 of
what was named “seas”. The “gathering” is NOT what is named “seas”. This
allows the interpretation that when the “appearing” of the dry land
happened what was “gathered” in ONE place got divided into a plural: the
“seas”.</p>
<p>And the fact that the proponents of the hydroplate theory do not find
feasible the famous canopy, that water that the bible tells us that was
ABOVE the heavens, because of the pressure, and because of the
temperature, and because the greenhouse effect, and because... to me
they sound like the same kind of excuses that many so-called scientists
have with this story in particular, with the theory of hydroplates: that
there is too much heat, and too much cold, and that the transfer of
heat..., and that a lot of energy...</p>
<p>If Jesus Christ really was resurrected, we may not understand all the
details of why there were waters above the heavens, or why the bible is
completely true. But that doesn't mean it can't be as the bible affirms,
or that I start to adapt it so that it fits with my prejudices.</p>
<p>To imagine tales of a past that fit the biblical description, and
what is observed today, that are coherent enough to call them
scientific, according to the most popular criteria, NOT the one in this
presentation, you just need exactly that: imagination.</p>
<p>Also to explain all the mass that exists in asteroids, meteorites,
comets and trans-neptunian objects that supposedly came out of this
planet, according to this story, it is much easier with that little
water that the bible says it was there, instead of multiplying six times
the width of the granite shell so that the data reported by the pagan
NASA fits with my theory.</p>
<p>Here we are not talking about technical creativity, the one that in
this presentation it is the only one that is accepted to validate a
scientific theory. Here we are simply talking about imagination. This is
just another story about the past, that which we cannot know.</p>
<p>In this story we only need imagination. Not as much as it’s needed
for the tectonic plates tale, but imagination after all.</p>
<h3 id="the-couple_DOT_"><span id="anchor-236"></span>The couple.</h3>
<p>The bible tells us that all human beings are descended from one
single couple Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>Many so-called bible believers tend to read Genesis as if it was
poetry. Or as if they were the parables of Jesus Christ. But the hebrew
used in Genesis tells us that it is a historical narrative. That what
Genesis narrates is exactly as it happened.</p>
<p>Many people find it hard to believe that ALL of humanity is offspring
of a single couple. The reason is the tale with which they have polluted
our brains since we were little: the tale of evolution.</p>
<p>A first observation is that mathematically it is much more probable
for a population growth, consistent with today's observations, to have a
recent beginning, than one from hundreds of thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>On the other hand, genetics, that one of which we do not have
technical creativity yet, that which has no idea how to create a lung,
or a kidney, from a drop of my blood, has recently begun to talk about a
genetic Adam and a genetic Eve.</p>
<p>Genetic Adam is identified with a single "Y" chromosome common to all
humanity and the genetic Eve with a single mitochondria common to all
humanity.</p>
<p>However, this kind of conclusions from genetics, which is a field of
study plagued by the story of evolution, is like concluding that because
two programs have common functions, or because two machines have equal
parts, then said programs and said machines must have a common
origin.</p>
<p>We can't even make our own program, or our own biological machines,
otherwise make me my liver from my drop of blood, and we pretend to be
able to explain, through what we do not understand, how was the process,
at the genetic level, with our ancestors. And without believing in the
existence of a creator. Absurd, right? But that's where we are.</p>
<h4 id="reproduction_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-237"></span>Reproduction.</h4>
<p>A model that we see on a day-to-day basis that supports the
possibility that all mankind is descended from a single couple just a
few thousand years is the reproduction of biological systems.</p>
<p>The 37 million million, or 37 teras, of cells in a human body, they
formed in just 40 weeks of gestation. All 37 teras of cells came from
just ONE cell: the fertilized egg.</p>
<p>The exponential growth that occurs when each cell divides by mitosis
in two others is a process easily comparable to a process similar in a
population in which each couple has as offspring two other couples.</p>
<p>And just as complete systems can come out of a single cell,
completely different systems as the respiratory, the digestive, the
nervous, circulatory, with specialized elements to carry out an specific
function, similarly, in a population that starts with a single human
couple, all the variety that we observe today in the human population,
can come from it.</p>
<h4 id="no-cheating_DOT_"><span id="anchor-238"></span>No cheating.</h4>
<p>However, with arguments that presume to understand the genetic
process of human reproduction they try to deny this possibility. First
BUILD me my lung, and only my LUNG, from a drop of my blood, to believe
that you really understand, at the GENETIC level, what happens during
the process of human reproduction.</p>
<p>Because if they want me to believe that they understand how the
program works, it is not enough for me for they to execute the whole
program and then SLICE the result.</p>
<p>One thing is to click on the icon and another thing to write the
program executed when you click the icon.</p>
<p>When we make LITTLE CLONES, either in the way that our Creator
intended, man with woman, or with other less pleasant methods, the only
thing that we are doing is 'clicking' the icon without having any idea
how the program works.</p>
<p>To believe them that they really understand human reproduction, at
the genetic level, first make me my KIDNEY from a drop of my blood. But
without cheating, JUST my kidney.</p>
<h3 id="dinosaurs_DOT_"><span id="anchor-239"></span>Dinosaurs.</h3>
<p>One of the main facts that must be taken into account whenever we
think about dinosaurs is that: every time a Carbon 14 test has been done
on dinosaur fossils, it has been found Carbon 14 on them. This means
that, according to the assumptions of the radiometric dating, those
dinosaur fossils can NOT be more than 60 thousand years old.</p>
<p>No person who believes the tale of evolution likes this fact. Because
the only alternative to the existence of the Creator of Heavens and
Earth is the tale of evolution. And if we don't want to recognize the
existence of the Creator, we decide to believe the lies that we were
taught in school. The tale of the frog.</p>
<p>However, there is clear evidence that the dinosaurs became extinct
recently, that is if they really are extinct. And there is clear
evidence that man always lived with these animals, that is if we are not
still living with the few that remain.</p>
<p>Nowadays, thanks to the Internet, it is easy to verify that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Different cultures around the planet, during different periods of
history, have drawn figures, sculpted and elaborated objects, with
different materials, of animals whose shape matches those of what we now
call dinosaurs.</li>
<li>Historical records, in different time periods, have narrated events
in which animals are described that coincide with what we now call
dinosaurs.</li>
<li>In different parts of the world there are fossilized human footstep
traces next to those of animals that we now call dinosaurs.</li>
<li>The vast majority of dinosaur fossils are found in groups of animals
that indicate rapid and simultaneous death.</li>
<li>Bones of these animals have been found that are preserved and
WITHOUT fossilizing.</li>
<li>Soft tissue of these animals has been found in some dinosaur
remains.</li>
<li>Residues of blood cells from these animals have been found in some
dinosaur remains.</li>
<li>Residues of blood vessels from these animals have been found in some
dinosaur remains.</li>
<li>Connective tissue has been found from these animals in some dinosaur
remains.</li>
<li>It has been found in the stomach of some of these dinosaur remains
residues of flowers, tree leaves, ferns, shrubs, algae and vegetation in
general.</li>
<li>There are recent testimonies, in different parts of the planet, that
claim to have seen animals that match what we now call dinosaurs.</li>
<li>Until the 19th century the word “dragon” was found in some
dictionaries as a word that refers to animals that we now call
dinosaurs. Some dictionaries even note that these animals are in danger
of extinction.</li>
</ol>
<p>But what happens when this evidence is found? Nothing, nothing
happens. It is simply ignored, denied or misrepresented because it is
not consistent with the story of the millions of years that they taught
us in school. It is not consistent with the tale of the frog.</p>
<p>There are several reptilian animals that have the appearance of what
we now call dinosaurs. In fact the word "dinosaur" means "terrible
lizard". Several of these animals never stop growing.</p>
<p>Now days most of these reptiles don't live long but it's quite
possible that they lived hundreds of years before the planetary
flood.</p>
<p>There are fossils animals, such as winged insects, which due to their
size they couldn't fly in today's atmosphere. These fossils suggest that
before the radioactive fallout of the planetary flood, these animals
grew much more. Now imagine an 800 year old iguana that never stopped
growing. That would be a terrible iguana.</p>
<h4 id="biblical_DOT_"><span id="anchor-240"></span>Biblical.</h4>
<p>Additionally, the bible describes some animals that resemble some of
those that we now know as dinosaurs.</p>
<p>In Job 40 it says that: <strong>“See now, behemoth, which I made as
well as you. He eats grass as an ox. Look now, his strength is in his
thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly. He moves his tail like
a CEDAR. The sinews of his thighs are knit together. His bones are like
tubes of BRONZE. His limbs are like BARS OF IRON. He is the CHIEF of the
ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword. Surely the mountains
produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play. He lies
under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh. The
lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround
him. Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble. He is confident,
though the Jordan swells even to his mouth. Shall any take him when he
is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?”</strong> <a
href="#fn713" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref713"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>713</sup></a>.</p>
<p>By that description, the Behemoth closely resembles what we now call
sauropods.</p>
<p>In Job 41, concerning Leviathan, it says: <strong><strong>“I will not
keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his MIGHTY STRENGTH, nor his
goodly frame. Who can strip off his outer garment? Who will come within
his JAWS? Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is
TERROR. Strong scales are his pride, shut up together with a close seal.
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. They are
joined to one another. They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled
apart. His sneezing FLASHES out light. His eyes are like the eyelids of
the morning. Out of his mouth go burning torches. SPARKS of FIRE leap
out. Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot over a fire
of reeds. His breath kindles coals. A flame goes out of his mouth. There
is strength in his neck. Terror dances before him. The flakes of his
flesh are joined together. They are firm on him. They can’t be moved.
His heart is as FIRM as a STONE, yes, firm as the lower millstone. When
he raises himself up, the mighty are AFRAID. They retreat before his
thrashing. If one </strong><strong>attacks him with the SWORD, it CAN’T
prevail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. He counts IRON
as STRAW; and BRONZE as ROTTEN WOOD. The arrow can’t make him flee.
Sling stones are like chaff to him. Clubs are counted as stubble. He
laughs at the rushing of the javelin. His undersides are like sharp
potsherds, leaving a TRAIL in the mud LIKE a threshing SLEDGE. He makes
the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment. He
makes a path shine after him. One would think the deep had white hair.
On earth there is not his equal, that is MADE WITHOUT fear. He sees
everything that is high. He is KING over all the sons of
pride”</strong></strong> <a href="#fn714" class="footnote-ref"

<p>By that description, Leviathan could easily be some kind
tyrannosaurs.</p>
<p>The bible also contains evidence that these animals always lived with
humans.</p>
<h3 id="taxonomy_DOT_"><span id="anchor-241"></span>Taxonomy.</h3>
<p>The classification of animals is currently plagued by the story of
evolution, with the tale of the frog. The classification criteria are
those of a genetic evolution that NEVER happened.</p>
<h4 id="th-century_DOT_"><span id="anchor-242"></span>18th century.</h4>
<p>At the beginning of the 18th century, the classification was more
evident. Literally. The classification of the father of modern, LISTEN:
MODERN, taxonomy was simple and according to the evidence observable
with the naked eye.</p>
<p>He classified more than 40 thousand animals in only 6 large groups
that translated from latin, because he liked latin, they would be
something like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>quadrupeds,</li>
<li>birds,</li>
<li>amphibians,</li>
<li>fish,</li>
<li>insects and</li>
<li>worms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course it is just a name because among the quadrupeds were men and
apes.</p>
<p>In their first versions, the quadrupeds had 33 kinds of animals,
birds had 47 kinds, amphibians 4 kinds, fish 41 kinds, insects 47 kinds
and worms 19 kinds.</p>
<p>He called these kinds of animals “genera” or “genus” in english. Over
time, the classification acquired more levels, but in its first versions
it didn’t have neither families nor classes for example.</p>
<p>In these first classifications of animals by "genera" can be
distinguish names such as “equus”, “elephas”, “tigris”, “canis”,
“felis”, “camelus”, “simia”, “pavo”, “gallina”, “falco”, which logically
correspond to names such as "equine", "elephant", "tiger", "canine",
“feline”, “camel”, “ape”, “turkey”, “hen”, “falco”.</p>
<p>Each one would be a class or kind of animal that resembles each
other. Thus, among the "equus" we find the zebra and the horse. It was
one logical classification, simple. It was not biblical but it was
evident.</p>
<h4 id="biblical_DOT_-1"><span id="anchor-243"></span>Biblical.</h4>
<p>In the bible, the classification of animals is even simpler, more
evident and of course among the animals it’s not the human being, but
there are dragons, that is to say the dinosaurs, those that were already
rare in the 18th century.</p>
<p>A first classification is flesh. And flesh in the bible has BLOOD.
And the blood in the bible is RED. There is no blue blood in the bible,
nor yellow, nor green, nor purple, there is only red blood. Thus, one
first classification of animals is given by those that have red
blood.</p>
<p>A second classification is whether they live in water, on land, or
fly. Amphibians are among those that live in water.</p>
<p>Those that both live on land and have flesh, the bible divides them
in two groups: those that crawl and those that don't.</p>
<p>It is a classification that roughly corresponds to the one they teach
at school. Two large groups: vertebrates and invertebrates. In other
words, “flesh” and “no flesh”, because almost all of the vertebrates are
red blooded, so the comparison is approximate.</p>
<p>Vertebrates are divided into fish, amphibians, mammals, reptiles and
birds. That is water, land and fly. Where the land ones are divided into
mammals and reptiles. And the water ones would be the fish and
amphibians because the bible does not differentiate them.</p>
<p>It is a simple, logical and obvious classification. Much more than
those of the 21st century.</p>
<h4 id="few_DOT_"><span id="anchor-244"></span>Few.</h4>
<p>And why all this explanation?</p>
<p>Well, because if we take into account the classification by "genera"
of the father, LISTEN: FATHER, of modern taxonomy, at the beginning of
the 18th century, that is to say very recently, we only have a little
more than 80 kinds or types of animals to put in the boat built by Noah
and his relatives. These would be the same ones that Adam named in a
morning because YHWH did not put him to name insects, or aquatic
animals, or other supposed animals, according to some EXA-modern
classifications, of the 21st century, that cannot even be seen with the
naked eye, like viruses or BACTERIA.</p>
<h4 id="adaptation_DOT_"><span id="anchor-245"></span>Adaptation.</h4>
<p>The diversification of the animals that came out of Noah's ark, in
what are now called species, which is nothing more than the adaptation
of these animals to different environmental conditions, occurred after
the great planetary flood.</p>
<p>All the canines that we classify as different species are simply the
adaptation to a specific environment of the pair of canines that came
out of the boat that Noah and his relatives built.</p>
<p>But from canines only little canines come out and it has NEVER been
seen that from a canine comes out a little FELINE or a little EQUINE.
The same goes for all “elephas”, “tigris”, “equus”, “felis”, “camelus”,
“simia”, “pavo”, “gallina”, “falco” from the father of MODERN
taxonomy.</p>
<p>Among the evidence supporting this claim is that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is the case of animals of the same genus but of different
species, which supposedly cannot be interbreed, if they coexist enough
time under the same conditions, they begin to be able to
interbreed.</li>
<li>There is the case of animals of the same genus and of different
species, and that cannot interbreed with each other, for which there is
a third species of the same genus that can interbreed with the first
two.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the total number of animals in Noah's ark is even less than
what an average current zoo has and that is maintained by 3 or 4 people
in charge of the animals.</p>
<h3 id="noahs-ark_DOT_"><span id="anchor-246"></span>Noah's Ark.</h3>
<p>The bible tells us that YHWH commands Noah to build an ark made of
specially treated wood and 300 cubits long by 50 cubits wide by 30
cubits high. It also tells us that said ark ran aground in the mountains
of Ararat after the global flood water level began to go down.</p>
<h4 id="section-1"><span id="anchor-247"></span>1948.</h4>
<p>In the year 1948 a series of earthquakes and rains brought out what
is now known as the Durupinar Archaeological Site at Uzengili Turkey. It
was discovered by a shepherd in the area and later in 1959 identified on
an aerial photo by an experienced cartographer named Durupinar and
that’s why it’s now known by that name.</p>
<p>The reason Durupinar was struck by such a place is because of it’s
shape. From the air it looks like the deck of a ship. A huge ship.</p>
<p>After blowing up part of what looked like a ship’s deck, the
expedition of which Durupinar was part, they came to the conclusion that
what it looked like a boat "it was a phenomenon of nature and it was not
made by the man”. Popular encyclopedias on the Internet stay with this
conclusion. Perhaps it seems to them that BLOWING UP a place, that the
government of Turkey now recognizes as archaeological, it’s an efficient
way to excavate a site of archaeological interest.</p>
<h4 id="section-2"><span id="anchor-248"></span>2014.</h4>
<p>Several people have continued to push the investigation of the place
on their own. Without the financial help of any government but with
their own money.</p>
<p>As recently as 2014 a team from New Zealand led by a geophysicist
named John Larsen obtained permission from Turkey to scan the
resistivity of the ground in the area.</p>
<p>The result is simply undeniable: underneath what has the shape of a
gigantic boat deck, there is material of the same resistivity that has
the shape of the hull of a boat that would correspond to said deck. It
is rationally impossible to think that it is not a boat.</p>
<h4 id="the-facts_DOT_"><span id="anchor-249"></span>The facts.</h4>
<p>The facts of what has a boat structure are several:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It has the dimensions in royal Egyptian cubits given in the bible:
300 cubits by 50 cubits by 30 cubits.</li>
<li>It is in the ancient mountains of Ararat.</li>
<li>The translation of the local name of the mountain would be “the
mountain of the judgment".</li>
<li>It is close to a town that the locals know as “the town of the
8”.</li>
<li>Near the spot there are stone anchors of the appropriate size for a
boat of that size.</li>
<li>It is almost 1800 meters above sea level in a place where there is
no water nearby.</li>
<li>There are old maps that identified the place as the rest place of
the biblical ark.</li>
<li>The place was visited by pilgrims in ancient times.</li>
<li>The boat shape incorporates high math principles and advanced
knowledge of hydrodynamics.</li>
<li>His story is consistent with the histories of Sumeria, Akkad,
Babylon as well as the Torah, the Old Testament and all qurans.</li>
<li>Two additional scans carried out in 2019 with different
methodologies, by a specialized company contracted by Andrew Jones of <a
href="https://www.noahsarkscans.com/">noahsarkscans.com</a>, indicate
that it is a boat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Too many coincidences, of those that accumulate with exponential
effect. Actually there are more coincidences but they are not so easy to
confirm. Still, these are already too many coincidences. It's almost the
same as it happens with Internet searches. Statistically, and careful, I
emphasize in the term "statistically" for reasons that will become clear
later, it is reasonably impossible to deny that it is the boat described
in the bible.</p>
<h4 id="logistics_DOT_"><span id="anchor-250"></span>Logistics.</h4>
<p>However, if we ignore the two fundamental principles of this part 3
of the presentation, it is rationally unattainable to believe the story
of Noah.</p>
<p>Even in the 21st century, assuming current technology availability,
and assuming abundant resources, it is difficult to imagine the
possibility of such an enterprise.</p>
<p>How to build a wooden ark of that size? How to choose and transport
the animals to the ark? How to accommodate them in the ark? How to
maintain all those animals, food, manure, temperature, health, etc. for
a whole year, without anyone dying? How to explain that in such extreme
conditions a ship with such a load achieved its objective? How to
explain that the animals survived and then repopulate the planet?</p>
<p>That there weren't so many animals, that wood can be treated with
heat and pressure together with oils of vegetable origin and make a
material stronger than steel, that they didn't have to go after the
animals, that God explained everything to Noah, that Noah took more than
fifty years to make the ark, that the animals before the flood were
vegetarians including the T-rex, that it was a flood and not a gigantic
storm, that the waves in the area of the ark were passive, that they
were located in the area of the planet least affected by the great
rotation, that before the flood biological systems including humans grew
much larger and were much stronger than after the flood, that they only
carried baby animals and not adult animals, that before the flood it had
never rained on the planet, that everything can come out of a single
couple in a similar way to how every sexual animal comes from single
cell during its gestation, that before the flood animals and people
lived much longer because they did not get sick, that not all the
fossils that have been found are from that time because a fossil can be
formed in tens of years, that just after the flood the continental crust
had not sunk and therefore the crust areas were interconnected, that
specialization in feeding and environment as well as infertility among
animals of the same kind associated with such localized adaptation
occurred after the flood, that that’s why the fossils of already
specialized animals are subsequent to said specialization and location,
that in just a few tens of years there can be achieved great diversity
in appearance for the same kind of animal, that this and that and the
other.</p>
<h4 id="first-things-first_DOT_"><span id="anchor-251"></span>First thing's
first.</h4>
<p>It doesn't really matter how much evidence or arguments there are of
the possibility that the biblical narrative is feasible and true, if you
don't first believe that all those animals and those 8 people, by
logical necessity, had to be created by a Creator and designer with an
intelligence and knowledge that today’s man, with today's technology,
can hardly imagine.</p>
<p>And in order to accept that the story really happened, and that the
biblical narrative is historical, it is almost rationally impossible to
accept it without first believing that Jesus Christ is alive because
after dying on the cross he was resurrected.</p>
<p>The testimony about Jesus Christ is that he spoke of Noah as an
historical event, then if the testimony that Jesus Christ was
resurrected is true, then the biblical narrative about Noah must be
authentic.</p>
<p>That is why when this part of the presentation began, emphasis was
placed on these two biblical principles:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is a Creator, designer and intelligent, of all plants, animals
and person on this planet.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ is alive because, after dying on the cross, the Creator
He raised him on the third day.</li>
</ol>
<p>If these two fundamental points are denied, ignored, or not taken
into account, it is almost rationally unattainable to be able to believe
that the Noah's story is authentic.</p>
<p>That God, who the biblical narrative says spoke to Noah, was the same
one that made sure that everything happened as it is written in the
bible. He has always been and will be in control. Nothing absolutely
nothing takes Him by surprise. That is the God of the bible.</p>
<p>If you don't believe in that God, only He can make you believe in him
and drag you to his Son Jesus Christ. The promise is that, someday,
before or after the resurrection of the dead, He will do it, with you
and with EVERYONE, absolutely EVERYONE who has lived since Adam, is
alive, and will be alive.</p>
<h3 id="history_DOT_"><span id="anchor-252"></span>History.</h3>
<p>A good way to know the past would be to be able to repeat it at will,
without affecting it. Something like watching the movie of any past
moment in virtual reality and without intervening with its development.
But to really know it, it would also be necessary to be able to know
what each person is thinking. What are the intentions of each person.
Being able to see inside the human heart.</p>
<p>Human beings still do not have access to such technology and even
just a few years ago, video was something that could only be recorded
with very expensive equipment. In addition, the human being only had
access to video technology until the 20th century. And photography was
only achieved until the 19th century. That is why the history before the
19th century is sought to be known with two main types of evidence:
written and physical objects.</p>
<p>Only until the 15th century, with the construction of the first
movable type printing press, was that the written medium began to get to
the masses. Before the printing press, every book had to be copied by
hand and therefore they were quite expensive for the average person. The
printing press taught the common person to read because it allowed him
to have access to the written medium.</p>
<p>The historian, according to popular criteria, must be a scholar, that
is, a person with sufficient training for the task. The ideal is that
said person has the sole motivation to communicate the facts, the truth,
no matter how difficult it is to accept. He must have no political
interest, or economic or religious. He must have the ability to
summarize without omitting, and to write in a coherent and interesting
way.</p>
<p>In written sources, the ideal is that said source is the closest to
the events, that it has been written by a person with the
characteristics mentioned, that the origin of said source is known, and
that in case when a long time has passed, the copies of said source to
be as reliable as possible. That said copies have been made by people
trained to do so, with the greatest possible fidelity and methodical
way. It is also desirable to have more than one reliable source about
the same event. In this way it is possible to cross the different
sources. It is desirable to have copies, for a given source, of
different instants in time, in order to compare them and see if the
narration has been modified, thus losing credibility. It is desirable
that the names of people and places be completely consistent with the
rest of the sources, including the archaeological.</p>
<p>The irony is that when a person or a group of people searches, really
research, compare, analyze, collect sources and compare them, and over
time he concludes that, by comparison, in each of the points mentioned
above, the best compilation of historical written sources that exists is
precisely the bible, that person, all of the sudden becomes, in the eyes
of those who haven't done their homework, PRE-judgmental.</p>
<p>The one who was judicious in doing the task is the "prejudicial" one
in the eyes of those who have not done their homework, of those who form
a judgment before doing their homework, in the eyes of the
PRE-judicious. He is accused of being "brain washed”, as if it were a
bad thing, by those who still have a sick, DIRTY and DEAD mind. Because
it’s precisely Jesus Christ who washes us, cleanses us, takes away our
sin, heals us, and gives us LIFE, with his Holy Spirit, not only to our
brain, but to our mind and body.</p>
<p>Some who start the task, but do not finish it, and do it halfway, as
the most internationally renowned institute of history dedicated to
promote the story of evolution, even recognizes that, and I open quotes,
“much of the Bible, in particular the historical books of the old
testament, are as accurate historical documents as any that we have from
antiquity and are in fact MORE accurate than many of the Egyptian,
Mesopotamian, or Greek histories”, close quotes. That is what this
institute of propaganda of the lie of the evolution, of the story of the
frog, has to say about the bible. And of course it does not consider
Genesis as included in its comment.</p>
<p>The Book of Genesis, or Bereshit in hebrew, has always been
considered by its readers as a historical book with the exception of the
two last centuries. The literary style of Genesis tells us that it is a
historical narration and was considered so by its readers throughout
history. Only until the 19th century, when the lie of evolution got
popularized, was that people, even among believers in Jesus Christ,
began to see it differently.</p>
<p>But it is not the only case in which the veracity of the bible has
been doubted. It has happened with people like Nimrod, David, Balthazar,
Pilate, Darius, with cities or empires like Akkad, Ur, the Hittites, and
Nineveh, that before being RE-discovered or identified, they were used
to discredit the veracity of the bible, only to get later, after being
RE-found or identified, being ignored or despised as evidence of
Biblical truthfulness by those PRE-judicious.</p>
<p>The bible is first used to discredit its historicity, and when
confirmed it gets ignored. Many of the historians who initially doubt
the veracity of the bible, once they finish the task, and they come to
the conclusion that it is completely reliable, then, they are simply
ignored as if they had always held that position.</p>
<p>One of the most important archaeologists and scholars, one of the
opponents in the 19th century of the book of the Acts as historically
reliable, after finishing his task, he arrived at the conclusion that
Luke in each of his mentions of 32 countries, 54 cities, 9 Mediterranean
islands and 95 people of historical renown he didn't make a single
mistake. Now he is disregarded as just a New Testament scholar as if he
was always so.</p>
<p>The bible presents much more rigor and accuracy than what is observed
in modern cases. The first year the Encyclopedia Britannica was
published it contained so many mistakes regarding places in the United
States that it had to be recalled.</p>
<p>Until just the last century, one of the arguments, or rather excuses,
against the historical reliability of the old testament was that the
oldest copy, the oldest manuscript, was from 900 years after Jesus
Christ. Once they found the scrolls from Qumram, near the Dead Sea, in
Israel, dated from about a thousand years before, and compared them with
the ones we had, the conclusion of the preservation of the old testament
became undeniable.</p>
<p>Archaeological evidence? The archaeological record of entire cities,
entire empires, entire civilizations, the entire planet in its
geological features is evidence of the truth of the bible.</p>
<p>The problem is not in the evidence, that our Creator guarantees that
He will preserve, but in the heart of man, that which also guarantees us
that He will circumcise in due time.</p>
<p>We were made to worship our Creator, for our own good.</p>
<p>The bible is historically reliable.</p>
<h3 id="the-column_DOT_"><span id="anchor-253"></span>The Column.</h3>
<p>In the bible there are a series of verses that give us a column of
events. A series of verses that if placed temporally make it impossible
to deny what the bible says about the history of humanity.</p>
<p>The date King Solomon began the construction of YHWH's temple can be
ratified externally by synchronisms with the chronology of the
neo-Assyrians.</p>
<p>In addition to the large amount of archaeological information
regarding the chronology of the kings recorded in the books of Kings and
Chronicles in the bible they also confirm that Solomon began the
construction of the temple in the year 966 before Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>From this date it can be established when the exodus took place
according to the bible. In 1st Kings 6 it says that <strong>"And it came
to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of
Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of
Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second
month, that he began to build the house of the Lord” <a href="#fn715"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref715"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>715</sup></a></strong>. Mathematical subtraction
tells us that the exodus began in the year 1446 before Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In Exodus 4 it says that: <strong>"Now the sojourning of the children
of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. And it
came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the
selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out
from the land of Egypt” <a href="#fn716" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref716" role="doc-noteref"><sup>716</sup></a></strong>.
Mathematical subtraction tells us that 1876 before Jesus Christ was the
year that Jacob entered Egypt with the Israelites, when Joseph was
already second in command in Egypt. At that time Joseph sent chariots to
pick up Jacob and his family, who were in Beersheba.</p>
<p>And with the generations given in Genesis 5 and 11, the age that
Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, the age at which Jacob
died, and the time that Jacob lived in Egypt, data that we find it all
in Genesis, it can be calculated the dates of birth and death of each of
the people in those genealogies back to Adam.</p>
<p>This mathematical operation gives us a date on which the events
narrated in Genesis 1 and 2 occurred that indicate a few thousand years
ago. NOT tens of thousands, not hundreds of thousands, not millions of
years. That is what what the bible says. The one that God promises to
protect, keep and preserve.</p>
<p>These three dates establish the biblical column of the history of the
humanity on this planet.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In 966 before Jesus Christ Solomon began the construction of the
temple.</li>
<li>In 1446 before Jesus Christ the exodus began.</li>
<li>In 1876 before Jesus Christ Jacob entered Egypt.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="genealogies_DOT_"><span id="anchor-254"></span>Genealogies.</h3>
<p>The genealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 add up to a different total of
years depending on the manuscript you read. There are 2 large groups of
manuscripts, two great traditions of manuscripts, of which derive the
texts of Genesis that we read today in our own idiom:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Manuscripts derived from the Septuagint and</li>
<li>Manuscripts derived from the Masoretic.</li>
</ol>
<p>The genealogies of the Septuagint always add up to more than a
thousand years higher than the sum of those of the Masoretic. Both
cannot be right.</p>
<p>Under the principles of this part 3 of the presentation only one of
the two is true.</p>
<p>This means that either:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Masoretic is true and the Septuagint lengthened the ages at
which the parents had their children in the Masoretic EXTENDING thus the
complete chronology, or exclusively:</li>
<li>The Septuagint is true and the Masoretic shortened the ages at which
the parents had their children in the Septuagint SHORTENING thus the
complete chronology of the Septuagint.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the discipline of textual criticism the most important of the
fundamental principles, called canons, is that: “in a difference among
manuscripts, the manuscript that can best explain the others is the most
probably correct”.</p>
<p>The arguments and evidence that allow this host to prefer the
chronology we find in the Septuagint are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As of the date of this presentation, and for the text of the
chronologies in Genesis 5 and 11, the Septuagint manuscripts are much
more older than those of the Masoretic. The codex Vaticanus and the
codex Sinaiticus of the Septuagint are dated to the 4th century while
the Aleppo codex and the Leningrad Codex of the Masoretic are dated to
the 10th and 11th century. This may change, for the text in question,
with the manuscripts in hebrew found in Qumram and that have not been
published yet.</li>
<li>The reason that can be argued to EXTEND an alleged original
Masoretic chronology is that it was desired to make consistent the
chronology of Genesis with the existant Egyptian chronologies before the
Septuagint, in particular that of Manetho in the 3th century before
Jesus Christ. If in the middle of the 3rd century before Jesus Christ,
when the hebrew scriptures were translated into greek and it was
produced the Septuagint, the motive was to make the hebrew holy
scriptures consistent chronologies with existant Egyptian chronologies,
this objective was not achieved. The Septuagint chronology is not
consistent with anyone of the Egyptian chronologies of that time, in
particular that of Manetho that does not take into account any of the
co-reigns and parallel kingdoms that have been deduced in modern
chronologies of Egypt. Much less the elongated Egyptian chronologies of
that moment that lengthened the chronology of Egypt even to be 7 and 8
millennia of existence. To be consistent with any of these chronologies,
the Septuagint would have to have a much larger chronology. Longer than
the one it has in any case. The alleged reason to EXTEND an original
chronology was NOT fulfilled.</li>
<li>The reason that can be argued to SHORTEN an alleged original
chronology of the Septuagint is that it was desired to deny the
reliability of the Septuagint as a text of the Tanakh for the Jews and
in this way prevent the Jewish population from reading the texts of the
new testament that were being distributed as part of the Septuagint for
the growing Christian movement. If this was the objective, it was
achieved, even to the point that today we have to argue why the
reliability of the Septuagint genealogies is greater than those of the
Masoretic. The use of the Septuagint by the Jewish population declines
markedly in the years when the Seder-Olam-Rabbah chronology, based on an
alleged original Masoretic chronology, began to be distributed by the
rabbinical authority among the Jewish population of the 2nd century. The
alleged reason to SHORTEN an original chronology was FULFILLED.</li>
<li>The most important event in all of human history is the resurrection
of Jesus Christ. Seems like a much more important reason to try to hide
or prevent the Jewish population from learning about all the evidence
that the new testament shows in favor of Jesus Christ being the Jewish
Meshiakh, than to try to match the chronology of the tanakh, the sacred
text of the Jews, and therefore of supreme importance to the Jewish
translators who produced the Septuagint, with chronologies of some
uncircumcised and pagan people like the greeks or the Egyptians. The
motive for SHORTENING the chronology is much stronger than the motive to
EXTEND the chronology.</li>
<li>There is no witness between the time of the alleged EXTENSION of the
chronologies during the production of the Septuagint and the destruction
of the second temple that accuses the Septuagint of altering the
chronologies of Genesis 5 and 11. No witness reports a lengthening of
the chronology up to the time of the alleged shortening. The Septuagint
is accused of EXTENDING the chronology late very late.</li>
<li>There are several witnesses of the first centuries after the alleged
SHORTENING of the chronologies in the Masoretic that accuse the rabbis
of altering the chronologies of Genesis 5 and 11. Among them, Eusebius
in 310 after Jesus Christ, Julián of Toledo in the mid-600s after Jesus
Christ, and James of Edessa also in the mid 600s after Jesus Christ.
Thus, several witnesses denounce a shortening of the chronology shortly
after the alleged shortening. The Masoretic is accused of SHORTENING the
chronology soon very soon.</li>
<li>The only external witness, prior to the destruction of the second
temple in Jerusalem, which partially ratifies the short chronology of
the Masoretic is the Book of Jubilees. This book has been dated from the
2nd century before Jesus Christ and considered as pseudo-epigraphy by
almost all of Christianity from its inception, with the rare exception
of the Ethiopians, and it’s not even considered canonical by the Jews
themselves, with the exception of the Ethiopian Jews. Pseudo-epigraphy
means FALSELY titled, in this case someone writes it in the 2nd century
before Jesus Christ, and tries to simulate that it was written at the
time of Moses. The only external witness in favor of the Masoretic
chronology is a pseudo-epigraphy.</li>
<li>The fragment coded 11QJub found in Qumram is the only one containing
parts of the 4th chapter of the Book of Jubilees according to a popular
Dead Sea Scroll list. Nevertheless it is very difficult to imagine the
scholar who was able to put something together, even readable, of the
verses that are supposedly supported by the 11QJub fragments. In the
portal <a
href="http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/">www.deadseascrolls.org.il</a>
you can see a photographic record of 11QJub and this host did not find a
single scholar article identifying the fragments by plate and fragment
number that support the chronology found in more recent manuscripts.
Thus, your host has the position that the Qumran manuscripts do not
ratify the chronology found in the Book of Jubilees. And thus the
chronology found in current copies of the Book of Jubilees may simply be
based on the Masoretic because its preservation has been in the hands of
Orthodox Jews. The ONLY outside witness in favor of the Masoretic
chronology may not even be a witness at all.</li>
<li>There are multiple external witnesses that confirm the chronology
length of the Septuagint before the destruction of the second temple in
Jerusalem. Among them, the Demetrius chronograph in the 220 before of
Jesus Christ, Eupolemus in 160 before Jesus Christ, and in very
important manner, The Book of Biblical Antiquities of the 1st century
because internal and external evidence indicates that it was written in
hebrew, by hebrews, in hebrew land, and therefore could not be based on
the Septuagint. Outside witnesses show that until the destruction of the
second temple, the genealogies in both traditions were those of the
Septuagint.</li>
<li>Also in a special way, as an external witness, is the disputed case
of the prestigious Jewish historian Josephus, in the 1st century after
Jesus Christ. The case is disputed because there is evidence of
intentional corruption in the copy of its originals. Josephus affirms
that he worked directly from the hebrew, which rules out that his
chronology was based on the Septuagint. His translation of Biblical
names into greek does not correspond to that of the Septuagint, but it
is a personal transliteration of Josephus, which confirms his claim and
his independence from the Septuagint. The evidence of corruption is
established because in various parts of his manuscripts Josephus is
found to assert a total sum of his chronology consistent with the
Septuagint chronology, but in some manuscripts the chronology as such,
it only adds up to a total length equal to the Masoretic. Thus, although
the chronology as such that survives today in the manuscripts that were
copied from the originals of Josephus corresponds mostly to the
Masoretic chronology, Josephus himself asserts elsewhere a total sum for
his chronology that corresponds with that of the Septuagint. Hard to
believe that the man did not even know how to add. At least until the
destruction of the second temple, the genealogies in both traditions
were those of the Septuagint.</li>
<li>The flood begins in the year 600 of Noah according to Genesis 7. It
is easier to explain why the chronological data for Jared, Methuselah
and Lamech are the same in both chronologies of Genesis 5 in a context
that shortens the chronology than in a context that lengthens the
chronology. In a context that shortens the chronology, one cannot
shorten by one hundred the age at which children are born for these
three gentlemen, as it was done with the rest, because they would have
survived the flood along with Noah. In a context that lengthens the
chronology this problem would not have existed. It is easier to explain
the chronology in the Masoretic from the Septuagint than the
opposite.</li>
<li>It is easier to explain the difference of only 50 years in the age
at which Nahor had his son in a context that shortens the chronology
than in a context that lengthens the chronology. In a context that
shorten the chronology you cannot shorten by a hundred the age at which
Nahor's son is born, as it was done with the rest, because he would have
had him before his own birth. In a context that lengthens the chronology
this problem would not have existed. It's easier to explain the
Masoretic chronology from the Septuagint than the contrary.</li>
<li>The number of levels in the archaeological evidence of the Egyptian
and Mesopotamian cultures are easier to explain in Septuagint long
chronology than in the short Masoretic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as in some judicial systems it is established whether the
accused had the means, the opportunity, and the motive, to commit a
crime. It is clear that the evidence and logic indicates that these
aspects are met much more easily for a shortening of the chronology by
the rabbis than for a lengthening of the chronology at the time of
production of the Septuagint. After the destruction of the second
temple, the rabbis had the motive, the opportunity and the means to
shorten the original chronology.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the evidence and logic indicate that the text of
the Masoretic is explained from a change in the Septuagint much more
easily than the text in the Septuagint from a change in the Masoretic.
Thus, the main canon of textual criticism points to the veracity of the
Septuagint.</p>
<h3 id="eridu_DOT_"><span id="anchor-255"></span>Eridu.</h3>
<p>The famous story of the tower of Babel is found in Genesis 11.</p>
<p>If we can believe the story of Noah, it is not so difficult to
believe a good translation of the story in Genesis 11. Some 50 years
after the death of Noah, the people still spoke only one language, the
one that Noah and his family spoke. God had commanded Noah to scatter
and populate the whole earth, but some rebels did not believed Noah and
decided to build a city and a tower so as not to be scattered. YHWH
makes them scatter anyway, maybe simply by the death of a certain
Nimrod, who was the one who directed the matter, and the construction of
the city and the tower stop. The scatter and settle of people in
separate places does what it always does and each group forms its own
cultural identity including its own language, and retaining something of
the grandiose idea of building pyramids and that is why we observe them
in all ancient cultures. The city where the rebellion began is
commemorated with a name that alludes to the event.</p>
<p>The arguments and the evidence that allow this host to affirm that
the ancient city of Eridu, of ancient Mesopotamia, located in the
Tel-Abu-Shahrain location near Basra, IS the Babel of Genesis 11 are the
following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is at the right place and construction began at the right time:
ancient Mesopotamia, cradle of the first civilizations or cities. It
makes no sense to look for Babel in the 6th century before Jesus Christ.
Or any other time when we observe various written languages on the
planet. Or at any other moment that contradicts the biblical chronology.
It can't be in the 2000 before Jesus Christ, the time of Abraham, or in
the 1500 before Jesus Christ, times of Moses. Or in the area of South
America or in the Chinese area. Additionally, ancient Mesopotamia is
close to the mountains of Ararat, the landing place of Noah.</li>
<li>There was a massive migration that left the area and was recorded in
the traces of artifacts and architectures, in the archaeological
evidence. This migration is known as the Uruk expansion. Expansion so
scattered, prolonged, and distant that it could have easily been called
the Eridu expansion because the two cities are so nearby that is
archaeologically indistinguishable from which of the two the expansion
began.</li>
<li>It has the appropriate name because Eridu is synonymous with Babel
in the ancient Mesopotamia. Even the Babel or Babylon of Abraham’s times
was also known as Eridu.</li>
<li>It had the largest temple or ziggurat at the time, by far, with more
than 15 distinguishable stages. And next to said ziggurat there is a
huge platform also started in the Uruk period, abandoned for several
periods, and ended at a much later period to build a normal sized
ziggurat on top of it. It was never built anything consistent with its
area on top of it. The area of said platform is larger than the sum of
the areas of the main complexes of the later Egypt’s pyramids. The
approximate area of the Eridu platform, using the famous Internet portal
of satellite maps, is about 358 thousand square meters, while the area
of the great pyramid of Giza is a little less than 53 thousand square
meters. It is almost 300 thousand square meters larger than the area of
the pyramids, and almost 7 times the area of the pyramids. The Eridu
platform is gigantic.</li>
<li>The other candidate cities do not meet all the conditions. Either
they are not at the right time, or they are not in a place where an
archaeologically recorded mass migration starts, or they don’t have a
TEMPLE of the size that Eridu had. And none of them have a PLATFORM of
the size like the one started in Eridu. It was simply gigantic.</li>
<li>The Sumerian witness of ancient Mesopotamia “Enmerkar and the Lord
of Aratta” confirms the story point by point. There was only one
language, they wanted to build a huge ziggurat in Eridu, the god of
Eridu stopped the construction, there was a scattering, and the god of
Eridu confused the languages.</li>
<li>Some versions of the Sumerian king list name the king of Eridu as
the first, which is consistent with biblical data of Nimrod.</li>
<li>The deities of Eridu are related to a global flood.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bible allows us to think that some 400 years after the time of
Nimrod, that is to say from the time of Babel or Eridu, in the time of
Peleg, the granite shell that was torn during the planetary flood,
settled or sunk more quickly than it had been doing, let's say in a
period of about two hundred years with an average of 10 centimeters per
month, and the water ended up covering and separating the points that
allowed humans to travel across and expand throughout the planet during
those 400 years.</p>
<p>All the evidence indicates that the story of Babel is the story of
Eridu.</p>
<h3 id="monumental-egypt_DOT_"><span id="anchor-256"></span>Monumental
Egypt.</h3>
<p>The year 525 after Jesus Christ was the first year after Jesus
Christ, when a monk calculated that Jesus Christ must have been born 525
years ago. From that moment on, the time system used by the entire
planet today was generated. System that has no year zero because from
year 1 before Jesus Christ you go directly to year 1 after Jesus Christ.
And that is also why, according to some experts, Jesus Christ ends up
being born in 5 before Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Before this absolute and global system of the king of kings, of the
lord of Lords, of the owner of the planet, the way to identify a date
was dependent on the little king reign. Each event was identified by the
year of the reign under which it happened. That is to say: the same way
as now, only that it was for each little king, because the king of kings
had not arrived yet.</p>
<p>This is why the most reliable method to determine the date of an
event prior to Jesus Christ has to take into account each little king
reign, the number of years that he reigned, if another little king was
reigning at the SAME time, the different names by which the SAME little
king was known, the different ways of counting a reign, if it was either
from the first full ruled year, from the first moment in which he began
to govern, or any other method, in which solar or lunar month the
calendar year began for the culture of the little king, if the reign was
counted from when he began to rule or from the time the father king was
dying, or any other way of counting that the culture of the day had.
Every chronology of every little king has to account for all these
details.</p>
<p>Synchronisms, those relationships that accept that two people, places
or events between different historical sources correspond to the SAME
person, place or event, are the bridges that allow to establish moments
that occurred simultaneously between two chronologies of different
reigns. This is the glue, which allows you to join the chronologies of
each little king with each other and in this way to put together a
global timeline.</p>
<p>In addition to these regional dates and synchronisms, you must also
cross this information with that obtained in the sequences established
by the layers or levels of ARCHAEOLOGICAL artifacts in the urban
settlements of each kingdom, of each culture that suggest a sequence of
events.</p>
<p>Details, details, details, that added together can double or triple
the total time of a chronology if they are not taken into account or the
wrong relations, the wrong synchronisms, are made.</p>
<p>The Rosseta stone was the archaeological artifact that allowed us to
begin to decode the hieroglyphs of Egypt because they contained the same
text in three different forms including greek and Egyptian hieroglyphs.
The archaeological evidence found in Egypt is literally monumental. The
gigantic monuments are full of hieroglyphics and being able to decipher
them was an archaeological achievement literally monumental.</p>
<p>The French champion who became famous for decoding hieroglyphs in the
famous stone, also formulated the most IMPORTANT historical synchronism
for the popular Egyptian chronology: That the little king, or better
said the little pharaoh, because he is from Egypt, named in the bible,
listen: IN THE bible, as Shishak in 1st Kings 14 <a href="#fn717"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref717"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>717</sup></a>, was exactly the same Sheshonk 1st
of the 22nd Egyptian dynasty according to Manetho. It seemed to the
champion that they sounded alike and therefore they had to be the same
person. Shishak is Sheshonk.</p>
<p>The bible says that
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n the fifth year of
king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem”
</strong><strong><a href="#fn718" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref718"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>718</sup></a></strong></strong>, and according
to the champion, that should be the same Sheshonk who attacked Israel.
The champion didn't even get the memo that Sheshonk went to the north of
Israel, not to Judah, where Jerusalem is, and therefore he could not be
the same person. The champion, based on the biblical chronology, knew
that Rehoboam's fifth year corresponds to 925 before Jesus Christ, and
therefore that should be the date that the guy Sheshonk 1st of the 22nd
dynasty attacked Israel.</p>
<p>And once the champion said it, that's how it happened. The reason for
trusting the biblical date for Shishak, NOT Sheshonk, is that the
historical sources, including archaeological information, and in
exceptional manner the astronomical records of the Neo-Babylonian
reigns, and the neo-Assyrian lunar system of years, have allowed to
confirm, verify, ratify, in multiple ways, the biblical chronological
information subsequent to Solomon, corresponding to the time of kings
and prophets in Israel. Everything post-Solomon has been confirmed in
multiple ways. For the champion it was easy to trust the date of 925
before Jesus Christ for the moment when the bible says that Shishak, NOT
Sheshonk, plundered Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Based on the champion's synchronism, that Shishak is Sheshonk, it’s
based ALL Egyptian chronology prior to 750 before Jesus Christ. AND ALL
the chronologies, of the ancient cultures of the Mediterranean, are
based on the Egyptian chronology to set absolute dates prior to 750
before Jesus Christ. In particular the Assyrian and the greek, are based
on the Egyptian chronology. It's a little snowball.</p>
<p>Before the Egyptologists arrived, the Mycenaean period, from the
greek culture, listen Mycenaean, NOT messianic, that of the famous Troy
of Agamemnon, the one in the movie, was dated between the year 1000
before Jesus Christ and the 750 before Jesus Christ, because all the
archaeological and written evidence indicate so, as well as the
synchronisms with the Assyrian culture. But when archaeological
artifacts from the Mycenaean culture were found in the middle of Egypt’s
18th dynasty, the champion's Egyptian chronology won and “TAKE IT” that
the Mycenaeans were no longer between the year 1000 and 750 before Jesus
Christ but they now were between the year 1700 and 1000 before Jesus
Christ. The entire Mycenaean greek period lengthened and was taken back
about 500 years on average. The egyptian evidence was monumental,
literally, and the champion had to be absolutely right. The validity of
the champion’s Egyptian chronology with all the errors of Manetho in
chronological sums of SIMULTANEOUS reigns was never questioned. And
since the greeks exchanged their pottery with the cultures of almost the
entire Mediterranean, “TAKE IT” that these cultures also went back about
500 years on average.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to the Hittites. Archaeological evidence was
found that Ramses 2nd of the Egyptian 19th dynasty fought those guys and
“TAKE IT” that the Hittites also went back another 500 years and
lengthened other much. The Egyptian chronology had to be correct. And
despite that the enormous local evidence in the archaeological layer
sequences indicates that the culture that inhabited between 1000 before
Jesus Christ and 750 before Jesus Christ, in what is now south-eastern
Turkey and northern Syria, is exactly the same of these Hittite guys,
the current interpretation that we read in the online encyclopedia is
that such Hittites lived about 500 years before.</p>
<p>These little errors generated what is known as the DARK AGES of the
greeks and the Assyrians. Those periods in which there is supposedly
MISSING evidence that they even EXISTED! It’s not that two immediate,
side by side, contiguous layers in archaeological sites of urban
settlements of these cultures indicate two immediate periods, one prior
to the other. Noooooo, that would indicate that the champion’s Egyptian
chronology is wrong. What happens is that, between those two immediate,
side by side, contiguous layers, THE EVIDENCE IS MISSING, of some 500
little years, that MUST have happened, because it is so according to the
chronology on which we base all our dates. Absurd, right? But that's
where we are. Says the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Based on the champion's synchronism and Manetho's cheerful accounts,
the exodus would have happened a few dynasties before the 22nd, in the
19th, during the reign of Ramses 2nd, who obviously did not drown in the
Red Sea, as the bible affirms that it happened to the pharaoh of the
exodus, because we have his MUMMY. Just as we have the mummy of ALL
pharaohs of the 18th and 19th dynasties. Is it then concluded that the
champion's synchronism is wrong?, that no little pharaoh of the 18th and
19th dynasties, in Manetho's accounts, may be the pharaoh of the Exodus?
and that therefore the Egyptian chronology is shifted 500 years?
Noooooo, what most of the academy concludes is that the bible was wrong
in that little detail, or that the interpretation of the verses that
tells us that the little pharaoh of the exodus drowned in the Red Sea
doesn't go that far, that the guy didn't even get wet, and that's why we
have the mummy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, based on the champion’s synchronism and Manetho’s
joyous accounts, Jericho should have archaeological evidence of having
been destroyed during one of the archaeological layers corresponding to
one of the pharaohs of the 18th or 19th dynasties. And since there is
none, since Jericho was NOT destroyed during ANY dynasty after the 15th,
because the archaeological evidence indicates so, is it concluded that
the champion's synchronism is wrong? and that there for, the Egyptian
chronology is shifted 500 years? Noooooo, it is concluded that Jericho
was NOT destroyed when they think the bible says it happened, but much
before and that when they think Joshua arrived there was nothing to
conquer, and everything was already destroyed.</p>
<p>That is to say that the biblical date in which Shishak sacked
Jerusalem, it is used to claim when was the date that the guy Sheshonk
supposedly sacked Jerusalem, which he never did because the guy went
north. To then claim that the exodus of the bible never happened because
in the calculated dynasty from that date there is NO archaeological
evidence found of any exodus. Typical example of circular argumentation,
but it is not questioned that the guy Sheshonk was NEVER the Shishak of
the bible. Noooooo, the champion was not wrong. The one that was wrong
was the bible and only when it serves to discredit it. The exodus never
happened according to the champion's bible. Absurd, right? But that's
how we are. Says the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>The monumental error of biblical interpretation has served to deny
the biblical truth.</p>
<h3 id="ur_DOT_"><span id="anchor-257"></span>Ur.</h3>
<p>The Mesopotamian Neo-Sumerian urban settlement known as Ur has a
number of features, consistent with the Ur of the Chaldeans Biblical
city, indicating that they are ONE and the SAME. The city from which
Abram's father left, because he had not been named Abraham, with part of
his family, because Nahor stayed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is in Mesopotamia, the land watered by what Noah thought were the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers of before the flood,</li>
<li>It is close to Eridu, Nimrod's babel.</li>
<li>It is in the land of Shinar, ancient Sumeria.</li>
<li>It was the land of the Chaldeans.</li>
<li>It has the SAME name !</li>
</ol>
<p>Archaeological evidence has been found in Ur that details some of the
its technological achievements.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 19th century, a wooden artifact was found,
known as "The Standard of Ur", in the tomb of what is believed a king of
Ur’s 3rd dynasty. The artifact is a wooden box that has drawings showing
something of the culture of Ur. In it you can see animals pulling wooden
cars in which up to two people are mounted.</p>
<p>If Noah's story is true, these animals would be those of which a big
part of the equines adapted.</p>
<p>If the bible is true and Ur is Ur, Abraham, when he was still Abram,
was in Egypt with his people, almost 25 years before his son Isaac was
born, even before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is hard to
imagine that his father, who died before Abram finished the trip to
Egypt, when he left Ur with Abram, that he would FORGET to put his
things, and his people, in those cars that we know Ur’s people had.</p>
<p>However, the online encyclopedia and the vast majority of
Egyptologists would have us to believe that the Egyptians did not know
about the use of cars for warfare or for transportation until the
descendants of Abraham had already left Egypt about 500 years after
Abraham had visited Egypt in his cars brought from Ur.</p>
<p>No. That Ur is not Ur. Since they don't find cars around those little
drawings among the tombs and mummies, which they interpret to be after
the 15th dynasty, they knew nothing about cars. And that glyph that look
like a wheel that is observed from the earliest dynasties means nothing
to them. NO, they have to see the whole car drawn, otherwise it cannot
be a car. That the exodus pharaoh cannot be earlier than the 15th
dynasty because only up to that moment they found out that cars existed.
That because they do not find archaeological artifacts of all the cars
made by people of Sumeria, of Akkad, and all the other Mesopotamian
cultures that followed Ur. That NO Egyptian who lived before the 15th
dynasty saw cars made by all those cultures. Could it really be that all
those cultures NEVER made all the cars that they made?</p>
<p>Ofcourse they won’t find ANYTHING! The vast majority of all those
cars were 100 percent BIODEGRADABLE! Can't they see those cars were made
of wood? Probably at the time of the exodus, in 1446 before Jesus
Christ, in the 13th dynasty of Egypt, only the pharaoh and his personal
guard would have cars with metal wheels.</p>
<p>They try to make us believe that never, for more than a thousand
years, Egyptians had NO contact with the people who lived in Ur, whether
or not they were from Abram, nor with the cultures that followed Ur in
ancient Mesopotamia. Noooooo, they were completely isolated, alone, and
they never knew about the horse-drawn cars. That no, that it’s a wagon,
that those are not horses, anything but cars. That it was the Hyksos
guys who finally brought the car to Egypt in the 15th dynasty. That's
what we read in the online encyclopedia.</p>
<p>And Abraham? Or rather Abram. He didn’t drive a car? And Ur? It was
not Ur? It really doesn't matter, because the ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE,
that which must be interpreted in any case, the one with which they give
so much mallet, indicates the opposite. That since the time of Abram,
the Egyptians already HAD to know about the car.</p>
<p>Ofcourse it was not a formula One, but a formula Ur, those made of
wood, of whole wheels, biodegradable, those of which we see little
drawings in The Standard of Ur, and that in order to NOT call it car,
the experts in Sumerian culture, they call it wagon, or cart, or
anything but car.</p>
<p>So no wagon, since Ur, the CAR was already used for war and for
transportation, a thousand years before the descendants of Abraham got
out of Egypt, the same Abram who traveled from Ur to Egypt, in CARS made
in Ur, since before the 3rd dynasty.</p>
<h3 id="sodom-and-gomorrah_DOT_"><span id="anchor-258"></span>Sodom and
Gomorrah.</h3>
<p>Sodom and Gomorrah are just the first two cities on the Jordan plain
that the bible affirms got burned into ashes by God with burning sulfur
rain.</p>
<p>Lot left Sodom for Zoar at the time of Sodom's destruction, but God
takes him out of the cities he is going to destroy and finally ends up
where God had told him to go in the first place: on the mountain. Since
the cities of the plain had been destroyed by rain of burning sulfur and
turned into ashes, Lot's daughters believe that there are no more men on
earth and decide to have children with Lot.</p>
<p>Along the western shore of the Dead Sea in Israel are at least 4
large unique areas on the planet due to their chemical composition and
other physical characteristics that make them distinguishable, at plain
sight, from other geological formations around them.</p>
<p>In them, large structures composed mainly of calcium sulfate and
calcium carbonate with geometric shapes consistent with what would be
expected to be found if large constructions made of LIMESTONE were
destroyed by burning SULFUR RAIN in those areas. Shapes consistent with
what would be the remains of walls, doors, windows, ziggurats, sphinxes
and constructions originally made of LIMESTONE.</p>
<p>The arguments and the evidence that allow this host to affirm than
the remains of the cities of the Jordan plain, described in the book of
Genesis as destroyed by Jehovah with rain of brimstone burning, ARE the
structures that are observed in these areas along of the Dead Sea are
the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The more than 1.5 million graves estimated to be found in this area
that is now completely deserted and in which no one has inhabited for
thousands of years, it’s only explained if in a previous moment there
were large cities in that area. This evidence is consistent with the
biblical narrative.</li>
<li>The graves present evidence consistent with an area that was quite
fertile at the time. Remains consistent with many kinds of food are
found in these tombs. This evidence is consistent with the biblical
narrative.</li>
<li>They are in a place consistent with the biblical narrative: in what
is called the Jordan plains.</li>
<li>The chemical reaction product of the interaction of calcium
carbonate, sulfur dioxide, and oxygen, is the formation of calcium
sulfate and carbon dioxide. The chemical composition of the structures
is perfectly consistent with such a chemical reaction that describes
what would happen to buildings built with LIMESTONE that are burned with
a rain of burning compressed sulfur capsules, which is the way it is
described in the biblical narrative.</li>
<li>The structures are penetrated by millions of said sulfur capsules
with different diameters. The sulfur capsules are embedded in the middle
of the thin layers of calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate that make up
the structures. This is perfectly consistent with the biblical narrative
which tells us that the cities were destroyed by a rain of burning
brimstone.</li>
<li>The sulfur purity of these capsules is 98% on average. Unique on the
planet. The sulfur found in geothermal areas does not exceeds 45%.</li>
<li>The biblical description of the cities being turned to ashes is
perfectly consistent with the observed structures. The thin layers
surfaces that make up the structures of the area dissolve when
touched.</li>
<li>The structures present evidence consistent with having achieved very
high temperatures. The thin layers that make up the structures present
eddies that would be the result of the thermal ionization suffered by
these layers during their combustion.</li>
<li>The geometric shapes of the structures are consistent with what
would be the remains of walls, doors, windows, ziggurats, sphinxes and
buildings originally made of limestone.</li>
<li>There is evidence indicating that throughout history those
structures have been identified with the cities in the biblical
narrative. The historian Josephus claims to have visited the cities and
even to have seen the ashes of what would be Lot's wife. And there is
evidence of a church once built in the area.</li>
</ol>
<p>White it is, hen lays it, fried and with bread we eat it. These are
too many coincidences, those that have an exponential effect when
accumulate. And if you want to dismiss all the evidence by saying that
the Biblical narration is assembled based on pre-existing structures,
you would still have to explain the number of tombs found in the area
and its content.</p>

<p>Synchronisms, those relationships that establish that two people,
places or events between different historical sources correspond to the
SAME person, place or event, are the bridges that allow to establish
moments that occurred simultaneously between two different kingdom
chronologies. That’s the way the global chronological ladder of what
happened in the past gets built.</p>
<p>Due to the great problems with Manetho's cheerful accounts, with the
little mistake of the champion, and with the lies about the reign that
each pharaoh of turn commanded to put in hieroglyphs on gigantic
monuments that could be destroyed by his successors, the Egyptian
chronology finds, almost from its inception, a critic of turn who
proposes his own synchronisms.</p>
<p>Recently there are like 5 or 6 Egyptologists trying to bring down the
champion. However, the champion's synchronism is still there: Shishak is
Sheshonk. Says the encyclopedia on the Internet. There must be a reason.
The bible explains it to us by saying that:
<strong><strong>“</strong><strong>t</strong><strong>he
</strong><strong>WHOL</strong><strong>E</strong><strong> world lieth in
wickedness" </strong><strong><a href="#fn719" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref719"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>719</sup></a></strong></strong>.</p>
<p>Below, the following synchronism is sustained: The Imhotep, of what
it is known as the 3rd Egyptian dynasty, he is the same Joseph of the
book of Genesis in the bible, the son of Jacob.</p>
<p>To do this, the champion's little mistake, Manetho’s cheerful
accounts, and the biblical chronology column, presented before, are
taken into account.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Imhotep appears suddenly in the reign of Pharaoh Djoser, just like
the Joseph of the bible.</li>
<li>Imhotep was the first power in Egypt after the pharaoh, just like
the Joseph of the bible.</li>
<li>Imhotep interprets a dream of the pharaoh regarding a future famine
of 7 years, just like the Joseph of the bible.</li>
<li>Imhotep was not of royal blood, just like the Joseph of the
bible.</li>
<li>Imhotep saves Egypt from the 7-year famine by building grain stores,
just like the Joseph of the bible.</li>
<li>Imhotep was recognized as someone close to God, just like the Joseph
of the bible.</li>
<li>Imhotep imposed a tax on the inhabitants of Egypt, just like the
Joseph of the bible.</li>
<li>The post-famine pharaoh of Imhotep became very powerful, just like
the pharaoh of Joseph in the bible.</li>
<li>The corpse of Imhotep is not in his tomb in Egypt, just like the
corpse of Joseph from the bible.</li>
<li>The story of Imhotep became famous to the point that it became
mythical, just like the story of Joseph in the bible.</li>
<li>Imhotep is famous for refusing to use magic in medical treatments,
just like it would be expected from the Joseph of the bible.</li>
<li>The fact that Imhotep was the first to build a pyramid similar to a
ziggurat is consistent with the biblical narrative. In the bible,
Abraham and Jacob would have knowledge about the ziggurats in
Mesopotamia.</li>
<li>The fact that the pharaohs after the famine of Imhotep become so
powerful is consistent with the biblical story. In the bible the
inhabitants end up selling themselves as pharaoh’s slaves to be able to
eat.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main argument for not accepting the synchronism, that Imhotep is
the biblical Joseph, has been that the date for Imhotep in the Egyptian
chronology, based on the little mistake that Shishak is Sheshonk, cannot
correspond to the Biblical date for Joseph. If Shishak is not Sheshonk
and the champion was wrong, said argument is without support.</p>
<p>Since this synchronism, that Imhotep is Joseph, is not new, they have
raised arguments against it based on the myth of Imhotep: that he had
unattainable knowledge for Joseph, that he was the representative of
Egyptian gods, and this would be incompatible with a hebrew believer in
the God of Abraham, that Imhotep was a god not a man, that he
accomplished things that one would not expect from Joseph.</p>
<p>The truth is that if the Egyptians themselves made a myth out of
Imhotep up the point of making him a demi-god, all the supposed Egyptian
data of Imhotep that is not supported by different sources is also not
very reliable.</p>
<p>The coincidences mentioned between Imhotep and the biblical narrative
are of widespread acceptance in academia, that is why the argument
against the synchronism was the temporal discrepancy. If the synchronism
is temporarily feasible, it is very difficult to deny that Imhotep is
Joseph.</p>
<h3 id="nuweiba_DOT_"><span id="anchor-260"></span>Nuweiba.</h3>
<p>Unless you want to explain the biblical phrase from Exodus 14 that
tells us that <strong>“The children of Israel went into the middle of
the sea on the DRY ground; and the waters were a WALL to them on their
right hand and on their left”</strong> <a href="#fn720"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref720" role="doc-noteref"><sup>720</sup></a>
, listen, a WALL of waters to the right and a WALL of waters to the left
of those who cross, unless you want to explain that, the SAME way that
some people want to explain the biological systems that we observe in
plants, animals and people, that is, wanting to explain those WALLS by
MAGICAL processes, sorry SPONTANEOUS, which is basically the same, and
out of pure LUCK, without acknowledging, without accepting, therefore
DENYING, the hand of the Creator of heaven and earth and of ALL
biological systems on the planet, taking action to separate these waters
into WALLS, it is relatively easy to accept which has to be the
synchronism of the biblical place, or toponym, where the crossing of the
badly-called Red Sea happened.</p>
<p>The crossing of the Red Sea happened almost in the middle of the Gulf
of Aqaba in what is now known as Nuweiba.</p>
<p>The logical reasons and evidence that allow this host to assert the
synchronism are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Nuweiba is OUTSIDE of what was Egypt, although in a militarily
controlled area by the Egyptians, and the bible tells us that the
Israelites had LEFT Egypt BEFORE crossing the Red Sea.</li>
<li>To the north of the peninsula where Nuweiba is, there is a desert
and the bible tells us that pharaoh thought they were blocked by the
desert and decided to go after them.</li>
<li>The desert to the north of the peninsula was the land of the
Philistines and the bible tells us that God did not take them through
the land of the Philistines. Instead, he directed them to a place called
Pi-Hahirot.</li>
<li>Pi-Hahirot can be translated as "mouth of the canyon" and Nuweiba is
in front of a mountainous canyon mouth.</li>
<li>The bible says that Pi-Hahirot is between Migdol and another place.
Migdol can be translated as “fortified tower”, and north of Nuweiba
there is evidence that an Egyptian military tower once stood there.</li>
<li>Until the last century, there was on both sides of the crossing
point in Nuweiba, two large stone pillars with evidence indicating that
they were from Solomon’s time.</li>
<li>There are eyewitnesses and photographs of the pillar on the eastern
side, in Saudi Arabia, with evidence, in several languages, of words
such as: “Pharaoh”, “Egypt”, “Moses”, “Death”, “Water”, “YHWH”,
“Solomon” and “Edom”.</li>
<li>The pillar on the western side can still be seen today in the year
2021.</li>
<li>Nuweiba's full name was Nuweiba-al-Muzayyinah which can be
translated as “the waters of Moses opened”.</li>
<li>This synchronism is consistent with the synchronism that the
biblical mount Sinai is the place known today as Jabal-Maqla in Saudi
Arabia. That is to say that the coincidences of both synchronisms
reinforce each other.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jabal-maqla_DOT_"><span id="anchor-261"></span>Jabal-Maqla.</h3>
<p>According to the bible, something really spectacular happened on
Mount Sinai or Horeb.</p>
<p>It says in Exodus 19 that: <strong>“And it came to pass on the third
day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick
cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so
that <strong>ALL</strong> the people that was in the camp trembled. And
Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and
they stood at the nether part of the mount. And mount Sinai was
altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in FIRE: and
the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a FURNACE, and the WHOLE
mount QUAKED greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long,
and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a
<strong>VOICE</strong>” <a href="#fn721" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref721" role="doc-noteref"><sup>721</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Then YHWH begins to enunciate, with a voice of thunder, all the
commandments, but there comes a time when Exodus 20 says that:
<strong>“And <strong>ALL</strong> the people saw the THUNDERINGS, and
the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking:
and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. And they
said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God
SPEAK with us, LEST WE DIE” <a href="#fn722" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref722" role="doc-noteref"><sup>722</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Unless you want to explain this description of what happened at Mount
Sinai through a volcano, without recognizing, without accepting,
therefore DENYING, the VOICE that enunciated the commandments, and that
the story says that ALL people of Israel listened, and therefore DENYING
the direct intervention from the Creator, of heaven and earth, in the
event, is relatively EASY to accept what has to be the synchronism of
the Biblical place where Mount Sinai or Biblical Mount Horeb is.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this presentation the two contiguous peaks that
have similar characteristics will be referred to by the biblical name
Horeb.</p>
<p>Biblical mount Sinai or Horeb is the mountain in Saudi Arabia known
such as Jabal-al-Lawz or Jabal-Maqla.</p>
<p>The logical reasons and evidence that allow this host to assert the
synchronism are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Jabal-Maqla is in the area still known today as Midian. This is
consistent with the biblical narrative that tells us that Moses lived in
Midian, as the husband of a daughter of a local leader, when he sees the
burning bush on a mount called Horeb, the SAME mount where he later
brings all the people of Israel.</li>
<li>The area has two mountain peaks that can be seen with the naked eye
almost black in color consistent with the biblical narrative that
Horeb's peak was burned by fire when YHWH dictated the commandments with
a voice of thunder.</li>
<li>The name Jabal-Maqla can be translated as “burnt mountain”,
consistent with the biblical narrative.</li>
<li>The granite rocks that make up the Jabal-Maqla dome look burned on
the side of the surface, presenting a color almost black. And they don't
seem burned inside or on the internal side, presenting a typical color
of granite: light yellowish.</li>
<li>In the Jabal-Maqla area there are remains of what looks like an
altar built with uncut stones. This is consistent with the biblical
narrative that tells us that Moses built an altar with uncut
stones.</li>
<li>In the Jabal-Maqla area there are several places with inscriptions
that are not typical of the area, including typically hebrew drawings
like bulls and menorahs.</li>
<li>An arrangement of large rocks in particular, at the base of
Jabal-Maqla, and in the middle of a great plain, presents a great
quantity of drawn bulls. This is consistent with the biblical narrative
that tells us that the children of Israel built a golden calf to worship
him at the base of the mountain where they were camping.</li>
<li>The access area to mount Jabal-Maqla is fenced and with restricted
passage by the government of Saudi Arabia and it’s considered an
archaeological site.</li>
<li>The arrangement of large rocks with bull drawings, at Jabal-Maqla’s
base, and in the middle of the plain, it’s also fenced, with passage
restricted by the government of Saudi Arabia, and it’s also considered
an archaeological site.</li>
<li>To the north-west of Jabal-Maqla there is a large rock split in two
in what appears to be the remains of a water source that flowed from the
stone. This is consistent with the biblical narrative that God used
Moses to draw water from a rock at Horeb.</li>
<li>Halfway up Jabal-Maqla’s top there is a cave. This is consistent
with the biblical narrative that tells us that, many years after Moses,
the prophet Elijah was on Mount Horeb in a cave.</li>
<li>Halfway up Jabal-Maqla’s top there is a small plane. This is
consistent with the biblical narrative that tells us that Moses went up
with 70 elders of Israel up to a certain point and then left them there
waiting, along with Aaron and Hur, while he finished climbing the
mountain with Joshua.</li>
<li>Nearby, to what would be the altar that Moses built with uncut
stones at the base of Horeb, there are remains of marble columns forming
a circle. This is consistent with the witnesses that Solomon also built
a small memorial dome on Mount Horeb.</li>
<li>The local Bedouins identify the mountain as Jabal-Musa which can be
translated as the "mountain of Moses".</li>
<li>Ceramic utensils have been found in the area, possibly hebrew. This
is consistent with the Israelites passing through the zone.</li>
<li>This synchronism is consistent with the synchronism that the
crossing of the Red Sea was at Nuweiba. That is to say that both
synchronisms reinforce each other.</li>
<li>On a possible route from Nuweiba to Jabal-Maqla there is a place
with palm trees and 12 wells. This evidence is consistent with the
Biblical description of Elim. The coordinates of said place are 28 34
09.90N, 34 49 58.97E.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="synchronizing-egypt_DOT_"><span id="anchor-262"></span>Synchronizing
Egypt.</h3>
<p>When we analyzed in this presentation the 500 years shift that
generated the champion’s synchronism, that Shishak is Sheshonk, with the
rest of the historical evidence of the Mediterranean and the Middle
East, including biblical and archaeological evidence, no alternative
synchronism was proposed.</p>
<p>Actually the monumental mistake demands establishing a new
chronological mapping that DO match Egyptian evidence with all other
historical evidence, including the biblical and archaeological
evidence.</p>
<p>Today a growing number of Egyptologists accept that the Egyptian
chronology needs a, quote and quote, “revision”, although not all of
them accept it’s 500 years, quote and quote, “revision”.</p>
<p>This is why more than 6 different proposals have been presented on
how such revision should be done. Now it seems that every revisionist
Egyptologist has his own idea of how such a revision should be done.</p>
<p>Your host in this presentation, that is me Jose Luis Quiroga, based
on the evidence presented by a growing number of scholars on the
subject, considers that the chronological correspondences that best
establish a pattern of biblical historical coherence with Egypt are the
following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The 18th dynasty corresponds to the times of David, Solomon and
Rehoboam.</li>
<li>The 13th dynasty corresponds to the times of the exodus.</li>
<li>The 3rd dynasty corresponds to the times of Joseph, Isaac’s
son.</li>
<li>The 1st dynasty corresponds to the times of Abraham.</li>
</ol>
<p>And more specifically:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Thutmosis 1st corresponds to the times of David.</li>
<li>Hatshepsut corresponds to the times of Solomon.</li>
<li>Thutmose 3rd corresponds to the times of Rehoboam.</li>
<li>Neferhotep 1st corresponds to the times of the exodus.</li>
<li>Djoser corresponds to the times of Joseph, Isaac’s son.</li>
<li>Menes corresponds to the times of Abraham.</li>
</ol>
<p>The logical reasons and evidence supporting these correspondences are
the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the author of the Song of Songs is Solomon, then the poetic
literature and hymns from the time of Hatshepsut, from the dynasty 18,
they have to be simultaneous or later because the similarity is too
much. The Hatshepsut of the 18 must be simultaneous or after
Solomon.</li>
<li>If the author of Psalm 104 is David, then the hymn of the times of
18th dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten has to be simultaneous or later because
the similarity is too much. The Akhenaten of the 18th must be
simultaneous or later than David.</li>
<li>If the archaeological evidence at Nimrud indicating that a
contemporary of King Omri of Israel made a reconstruction of the city,
then Omri would have to be a contemporary of Amenhotep 3rd, from the
18th dynasty, because there are also a lot of Egyptian artifacts from
the 18th dynasty in the same stratum of the reconstruction. Amenhotep
3rd of 18 must be simultaneous with Omri.</li>
<li>If Jerusalem only acquired that name until the time of David, then
the Amarna letters, from the 18th dynasty times, have to be simultaneous
or subsequent to David because they use that name. The Amarna of the
18th must be simultaneous or subsequent to David.</li>
<li>If the city of Shechem was actually built by Jeroboam, then the
Amarna letters, from the 18th dynasty, have to be simultaneous or after
Jeroboam because they refer to that city. The Amarna of the 18th must be
concurrent with or subsequent to Jeroboam.</li>
<li>The stories of Abdi-Hiba of Jerusalem in the Amarna letters, from
the 18th dynasty, and the Biblical King Jehoram of Judah are almost
identical. Both suffered revolts from their territories from Philistia
to Edom. In both stories the Philistines plunder the king's palace with
"men of the land of Kasi" or "men close to the Kushites”. This is
evidence in favor of synchronism and therefore evidence in favor of the
18th dynasty extending to times of Jehoram of Judah. The Abdi-Hiba in
the Amarna must be Jehoram.</li>
<li>If the vocabulary, grammar, syntax, meter, use of parallelisms, the
idiomatic uses of the Psalms, as well as some stories from the books of
Kings are really original from the old testament, then some texts from
Ugarit on the tablets of Ras Shamra from the same period as the Amarna
letters have to be simultaneous or subsequent to the biblical texts. The
Amarna must be later than the Psalms.</li>
<li>Pottery from the greek Mycenaean period found at Amarna indicates
that the greek Mycenaean period is contemporary with the 18th dynasty
and the rest of the Mycenaean pottery, which the greeks traded in
throughout the Mediterranean, places the Mycenaean period between the
year 1000 and 750 before Jesus Christ. The Mycenaean greeks and the 18th
must be between the 1000 and 750 before Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>On the Italian peninsula, in Sicily, in Greece, in Malta, in Troy,
in Anatolia, in Palestine, in Sardinia, in the Aeolian Islands, and
others archaeological sites of the mediterranean the evidence in
ceramics, bronze, ivory, and other archaeological artifacts indicate a
temporal continuity in Late Bronze ages 2 and 3 strata corresponding to
the Mycenaean culture. The 18th must be between the 1000 and 750 before
Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>All the archaeological evidence of the greeks agrees with the
archaeological evidence of the Assyrians. Both coincide with biblical
evidence. All place the Late Bronze ages 2 and 3 between the year 1000
and 750 before Jesus Christ. 3 different systems with consistent
chronological data between each other place the Egyptian 18th dynasty
between 1000 and 750 before Jesus Christ. The 18th must be between the
1000 and 750 before Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>In particular, the ceramics of the immediate archaeological strata
7b and 8 in Troy indicate a temporal continuity between both strata. The
pottery from layer 8 at Troy is of the same type as the one found in
Amarna from the 18th dynasty. House number 814 of the stratum 7b is from
the Late Bronze Age. The 18th must be between the 1000 and 750 before
Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>In particular, the Hittite cavalry depicted in the tomb of Horemheb
of the 18th dynasty, and by Seti 1st of the 19th dynasty in his space in
Karnak, presents the same type of characteristics as the Assyrian
cavalry from the years between 1000 and 750 before Jesus Christ. Which
is evidence suggesting that these two neighbors never knew about mutual
advances in cavalry, or what is much more feasible: the 18th and the
beginning of the 19th are between 1000 and 750 before Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>The palace found in layer 8 at Megiddo that places it in the Late
Bronze Ages 2 and 3 is evidence indicating that said palace was that of
Solomon because said palace corresponds to the biblical description of
Solomon's palace. Solomon must have lived in Late Bronze Ages 2 and
3.</li>
<li>The ivory artifacts found in the stratum 8 palace at Megiddo are
evidence indicating that said palace belonged to Solomon because the
figures found in said artifacts are consistent with the biblical
narrative of the relationship between Egypt and Israel in Solomon's
times. Solomon must have lived in ages 2 and 3 of the late bronze.</li>
<li>The fortified constructions of the 2nd and 3rd Bronze Age found at
Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer have entries of 6 chambers in the same type of
stone indicating a central government from north to south, evidence that
is consistent with the biblical narrative that tells us that Solomon
built on these three cities. Solomon must have lived in Late Bronze Ages
2 and 3.</li>
<li>The seal of Tuthmosis 3rd found in stratum 7b at Megiddo, after the
palace of layer 8, is evidence that indicates that Thutmosis 3rd is the
biblical Shishak and therefore the 18th Egyptian dynasty with Tutmosis
3rd is simultaneous with the biblical King Rehoboam. The Thutmosis 3rd
of 18th must be Shishak.</li>
<li>One of the biblical ways of referring to the queen of Shaba is also
queen of the south. Evidence in favor of synchronism that Hatshepsut is
the queen of Shaba. The Hatshepsut of the 18th must be the queen of
Shaba</li>
<li>A possible pronunciation of Thebes, the Egyptian city from which
Hatshepsut reigned over Egypt, it’s Shebas. Word of local origin that
means “wild cat”, which is consistent with sphinxes with a "wild cat"
body shape. The Hatshepsut of the 18th must to be the queen of
Shaba.</li>
<li>The queen of Shaba, according to biblical evidence, must refer to an
important reign, not a secondary ruler. The Hatshepsut of the 18th must
be the queen of Shaba.</li>
<li>The historian Josephus identified the queen of Shaba as “The queen
of Egypt and Ethiopia", where Ethiopia in the context of Josephus refers
to the area of ​​Nubia, not to present-day Ethiopia. The Hatshepsut of the
18th must be the queen of Shaba.</li>
<li>The names of the characters in the story of the queen of Shaba,
according to Abyssinian tradition, they have great textual similarities
with the Egyptian names of Hatshepsut and Thutmose 3rd. The Hatshepsut's
throne name was Makeda and the Abyssinian tradition identified the queen
as Makeda. In Phoenician both letters are quite similar. In this
tradition Solomon is the father of the Shaba queen’s son, who then
plunders Solomon's temple, just like Thutmose 3rd did. The Hatshepsut of
the 18th must be the queen of Shaba.</li>
<li>The fact that during the reign of David and Solomon there were not
any wars with Egypt corresponds to what we know about the times of
Tuthmosis 1st, Hatshepsut’s father. Tuthmosis 1st of the 18th must be
David’s time pharaoh.</li>
<li>The journey to Punt in Hatshepsut's temple is represented with great
detail right in front of her birth. This indicates that Punt was an
important kingdom and not a secondary one. The Punt of the 18th must be
an important kingdom.</li>
<li>Thutmose 3rd conquered Punt during his 1st campaign. Evidence that
indicates that Punt was in the same area as all the cities and
territories visited in said campaign and discard any place far away from
these territories. The Punt of the 18th must be Israel.</li>
<li>All the evidence from the first campaign of Thutmose 3rd indicates
that the Punt’s conquered territory corresponds to the southern part of
current Israel. Evidence indicating that Hatshepsut's journey to Punt
was to said territory. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.</li>
<li>Evidence at Hatshepsut's temple indicates that Punt was identified
as “Ta-Netjer” or “Land of God”. “Ta-Netjer” in the Egyptian culture,
through multiple inscriptions, it’s directly related to Osiris and the
city Byblos in the current Lebanon. Evidence indicating that Punt was
sacred territory for the Egyptians and that therefore the journey to
Punt was of utmost importance and that Hatshepsut's presence was
required for her political interests. Hatshepsut's journey was to
Israel.</li>
<li>Egyptian records indicate that they considered they came from Punt
and archaeological evidence indicates that the Egyptians are of
Phoenician origin. Evidence that is consistent with locating Punt in the
Israel of Solomon. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.</li>
<li>The Phoenicians considered that the Egyptians had their origin in
Phoenician land. Evidence that is consistent with placing Punt in the
Israel of Solomon. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.</li>
<li>Archaeologically, during the 18th dynasty great development is
observed in the area of Israel, and on the contrary, only primitives
cultures in the other places presented as candidates to be Punt by
Egyptologists. Evidence in favor of the toponym that Punt is the Israel
of Solomon. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.</li>
<li>Numerous Egyptian inscriptions relate Punt to the city Byblos, and
the Egyptian goddess Hathor with Byblos, also called "Lady of Byblos"
and "Lady of Punt". Evidence in favor of the toponym that Punt is
Solomon's Israel. The journey of Hatshepsut was to Israel.</li>
<li>Biblical and extra-biblical evidence indicates that Solomon's Israel
was the most outstanding kingdom, in plant and animal variety,
especially in the Jordan Valley area, as well as in abundance of gold
and silver, especially in Jerusalem, among all the important cultures of
that time, including Egypt itself, the rest of Africa and the Eastern
peoples. Hatshepsut's journey was to Israel.</li>
<li>The coincidence in material, number and class of artifacts between,
the Biblical record of looting in Solomon's temple by Shishak, and the
record in the section of Thutmose 3rd in the Karnak complex, is evidence
in favor of the synchronism that Thutmose 3rd is the biblical Shishak.
Thutmosis 3rd of the 18th must be Shishak.</li>
<li>The name Kadesh means Holy in hebrew. Even now Jerusalem is known as
the Holy City. This coincidence is evidence in favor of the toponym that
Kadesh is Jerusalem in the Thutmose 3rd campaign of conquest to the
Solomon’s Israel southern territory. Thutmosis 3rd of the 18th must be
Shishak.</li>
<li>Reading the narration of the Ipuwer papyrus about the fall of the
13th dynasty it's like reading the biblical exodus. The similarities are
all over: the plagues, the Egyptian magicians, the deaths, the
lamentations, the fall of Egypt. It is basically the Egyptian record of
the exodus. This is evidence that the exodus happened at the time of the
13th dynasty. The exodus must have happened on the 13th.</li>
<li>All the support already presented for the synchronism that Joseph is
Imhotep reinforces the correspondence that the biblical Joseph lived in
Djoser’s times, Egyptian pharaoh of the 3rd dynasty, and is consistent
with the other synchronisms presented here.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, the correspondences of that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The 18th dynasty corresponds to the times of David, Solomon and
Rehoboam.</li>
<li>The 13th dynasty corresponds to the times of the exodus.</li>
<li>The 3rd dynasty corresponds to the times of Joseph, Isaac’s
son.</li>
<li>The 1st dynasty corresponds to the times of Abraham.</li>
</ol>
<p>And more specifically that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tutmosis 1st corresponds to the times of David</li>
<li>Hatshepsut corresponds to the times of Solomon.</li>
<li>Thutmose 3rd corresponds to the times of Rehoboam.</li>
<li>Neferhotep 1st corresponds to the times of the exodus.</li>
<li>Djoser corresponds to the times of Joseph, Isaac’s son.</li>
<li>Menes corresponds to the times Abraham.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the correspondences that allow establishing an Egyptian
chronology that does not generate archaeological gaps of 400 and 500
years in other cultures, and a logical coherence between the chronology
of Egypt and the other three chronologies that are already consistent
with each other: the Assyrian, the Greek and the Biblical.</p>

<p>There is a certain quantity of liquid. All that we know about the
liquid is that it is composed entirely of wine and water and that the
ratio of wine to water is between 1/3 and 3. What is the probability
that the ratio of wine to water is less than or equal to 2?</p>
<p>Question 1 is known in probability by the name of "the Bertrand
paradox”. A French namesake of this host because Bertrand's proper name
is Joseph Louis.</p>
<p>Question 2 is known as the “Ludwig Von Mises’ water and wine
paradox”. Ludwig was a Jew born in the territory of present-day Ukraine
that had to run to the United States.</p>
<p>These two questions are not really paradoxical at all, they just
point out the impossibility of generically applying what is known in
fundamental probability as “the principle of indifference”.</p>
<p>To the first question formulated in 1889 they have tried to find
solutions, that is, they have tried to shake it off, in various ways. To
the second question they simply have not been able to give answer, that
is to say that they have not been able to shake it off. The last attempt
was in 2004.</p>
<p>All these attempts fail because they try to answer the questions as
such and not the point they seek to make.</p>
<p>The point is that there is NO so-called "fair coin", a coin 0.5 and
0.5, that which was already discussed in this presentation. All REAL
coins are loaded to one side and every coin that can be described with
an ALGORITHM is pseudo-random.</p>
<p>In the case of fundamental probabilities, those that are based on the
principle of indifference, these probabilities depend, listen “DEPEND”,
on the way to choose that which supposedly has a random distribution in
a, quote and quote, “indifferent” way.</p>
<p>To really try to describe a behavior with probabilities it’s
necessary to determine, define, establish the function of selection, the
one they call random, the one that will never be really random but
pseudo-random, meaning almost random, because such a "fair coin" does
not exist.</p>
<p>In the case of fundamental probability, to be able to say that it
describes the functioning of a system, we must define the CHANCE
function, the random function. It is necessary to know the operation of
the selection function. Thus, said, quote and quote, “indifference”, of
the supposed "principle of indifference", of all fundamental probability
theory, only exists in cases where such a function is known. It cannot
be assumed that it’s known, it must be effectively defined or known in
order to FULLY describe the system.</p>
<h4 id="statistical-probability_DOT_"><span
id="anchor-265"></span>Statistical probability.</h4>
<p>Probability theories are born with card and dice games. They seek to
predict an event from past events, assigning a value to the possibility
of it happening.</p>
<p>In statistical probability, probability is understood as what it
really is: a relative frequency. I take my real coin, then I toss it a
million times and count how many times it came up heads, how many times
it came out odds, and how many times it came out standing on the edge.
Then with those counts I calculate the frequency of each possibility,
and thus determine the probability that my next toss will come up with
each possibility.</p>
<p>Thus, such "relative" of any frequency is always determined by prior
knowledge about the problem. This knowledge is used to establish
functional RELATIONSHIPS between the variables of the problem to study.
That prior knowledge is defined in terms of math functions.</p>
<p>In statistics the partial knowledge that we have about the operation
of a system is used to try to predict a future event. It assumes, or it
pretends, or it effectively ignores, the complete operation of the
system.</p>
<p>These types of theories are used in all types of systems where you
only have a PARTIAL knowledge of the global system, of one which
includes subsystems that I do know, and can control, and others that I
don't.</p>
<p>When my creation, that part of the system that I can describe
deterministically, that part that I can control, has to interact with
what I do not know, I seek to try, listen: TRY, to predict how that
interaction will be, in a probabilistic way. That's why in this type of
creations, which interact with external systems whose operation is
unknown, such interaction sometimes it works and sometimes it
doesn’t.</p>
<h4 id="creations_DOT_"><span id="anchor-266"></span>Creations.</h4>
<p>It serves nobody to have a probability of whether the parts of a
creation are or are not in the place where they are supposed to be, and
it is no use for anyone to have a probability that the parts of a
creation will or will not have the speed they must have for the creation
to work.</p>
<p>It is no use to anyone that the parts of their machinery might or
might not be where they should be and might or might not do what they
should do. You cannot build MACHINES in terms of knowing only
probabilities about, where its parts ARE located, and MOVE, and DO, and
the speed, and the momentum, that they MAY have or NOT. All of them
which they MUST have in order for the MACHINE to work.</p>
<p>Probability theories are completely useless to create a MACHINE
because they are not deterministic systems. They only serve to TRY to
describe a CREATION, once created, as if it had no CREATOR, that is,
pretending NOT to know the deterministic model that describes said
creation. They serve only to analyze a creation pretending, or assuming
that its complete operation is unknown. Pretending to use a probability
theory to explain the fundamental functioning of a creation is simply to
deny its CREATOR.</p>
<h4 id="quantum_DOT_"><span id="anchor-267"></span>Quantum.</h4>
<p>Every quantum ideology is, in its mathematical aspect, a probability
theory. They seek to calculate the probability that one, misnamed,
“elementary particle” has a given position, velocity, or momentum.</p>
<p>In the case of fundamental quantum ideologies, the same problem of
fundamental probability theories applies. That supposed "principle of
indifference" is false. The "fair coin" does not exist. We must define
the random function in each case. It can not be applied to try to
explain the fundamental functioning of matter. Assuming the supposed,
quote and quote, "principle of indifference" it’s a fundamental error
from a strictly mathematical point of view.</p>
<p>And in the case of quantum ideologies that use statistical
probability, the problem, at least from technical creativity criterion
point of view, it’s that they are not useful. They do not qualify as
science because they are not deterministic, they are useless to build an
object based on what they study: supposed elementary particles.</p>
<p>Statistics is used to analyze events of created objects, not to
create the objects. For this, deterministic models are needed. I need to
be able to predict what the pieces of my creation are going to do at
each moment so that my creation does what it's supposed to do.</p>
<h4 id="popular_DOT_"><span id="anchor-268"></span>Popular.</h4>
<p>I don't know if the idea is clear to you but what this means is that
the lovers of popular quantum ideologies, those who still use predictive
statistical systems, or even worse probability systems based on the
supposed “principle of indifference”, to try to explain, with
probabilities, the behavior of some supposed elementary particles, those
lovers, what they really need is a deterministic explanation about the
behavior of the supposed elementary particles so that in this way the
explanation does serve to build something with the supposed elementary
particles.</p>
<p>Perhaps they should begin to consider that the supposed elementary
particles, neither are they “particles”, nor are they “elementary”. They
really are stationary electromagnetic waves traveling in a medium which
has been denied its existence since the end of the 19th century, when
two of the most popular ideologies today appear: quantum ideology in
terms of probability and gravity in terms of curvature.</p>
<p>In the 19th century to a, quote and quote, "genius", the Satan, the
enemy, he put, in first person manner, the quote and quote, "great idea"
to ASSUME that the speed of light is always the same in empty space,
which is yet to be found, and postulate it as an AXIOM, meaning that it
is something ASSUMED and that it must be EVIDENT for anyone, of his
ideology, wrongly called theory of gravity. Not realizing that the
supposed axiom, not obvious to ANYONE, makes it mathematically reducible
to the ABSURD.</p>
<p>However, the MEDIUM in which electromagnetic waves travel has always
been there with the name of "electromagnetic field", even if they do not
want to call it MEDIUM, as they did in the 19th century before the
absurd ideology of gravity appeared thanks to its, quote and quote,
“obvious”, quote and quote, “AXIOM”, which ASSUMES that the speed of the
light is always the same in empty space that it’s still to be found.</p>
<p>Some even claim that the famous ideologue of the absurd ideology
thought that said MEDIUM had to exist because otherwise the second
version of its ABSURD ideology, based on the same AXIOM, would make it
ABSURD. Apparently the, quote and quote, "genius" never realized that
its AXIOM already made it mathematically reducible to the ABSURD.</p>
<p>Sad, right? But here we are, two quite popular ideologies, one
scientifically absurd, the other not only that but also mathematically
absurd, and both supposedly SCIENTIFICALLY proven theories, the
encyclopedia says so and the majority believes it.</p>
<h3 id="gravely-absurd_DOT_"><span id="anchor-269"></span>Gravely
absurd.</h3>
<p>At the end of the 19th century, outer space was believed to be empty.
In late 19th century, planetary motion was explained in terms of a
mathematical model that only depended on an attractive force. A
predictive model but obviously without creative force. Not even now can
we make planets, and if the bible is true we will not be able to, at
least not before the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>At the end of the 19th century there were no satellites in orbit,
there was no television, there were no airplanes, there were no orbiting
telescopes, there were no computers, there were no interoceanic optical
networks, there were no transistors, there were no microcircuits, there
was no Internet, there were no cell phones. At the end of the 19th
century mathematics had to be done by HAND, and if a process was too
complex to model with linear equations, it was impossible to solve the
equations in almost all cases.</p>
<p>In that context, a german Jew who liked to stick out his tongue had
the idea that the entire universe could be described in terms of an
attractive force, and ONLY attractive, that is to say that it can only
attract, known as gravity. In his THOUGHT experiments, since he could
not do them in practice, he decided that an axiom, that which must be
obvious to anyone, of his descriptive theory, because it only serves for
that, was that the speed of light is always the same in empty space,
because outer space was believed to be empty. Obviously he chose as a
mathematical model something that was fashionable at the time such as
tensor theory, an algebraic model that allows to work vectors and
scalars in virtually any form the user likes.</p>
<p>He stuck out his tongue and thought: "We have a three-dimensional
space, meaning a vector space, a scalar time, and we can use tensors to
work the two as if it were a 4-dimensional mathematical space and that's
it! Let us describe the universe. That one that at the end of the 19th
century did not leave the galaxy and it only had about 300 thousand
stars. Those of which we do NOT know their distances.</p>
<p>As the first theory did not come out so general, then he thought of a
general one. They also had the attraction that since they were described
with NON linear equations, NOBODY at that time could solve them for the
general case. Let's remember that math had to be done by HAND.</p>
<p>The equations also had another attraction: factors could be inserted
and removed at taste. In the beginning he decided that it would be nice
to have a stable universe and he put his factor, that little sum or
multiplication that you inserted at school when the equations didn't add
up. That which some people call CHEATING. Later it occurred to this guy
that the famous red shift, which we already talked about in this
presentation, meant an expanding universe, and decided he had made a
mistake and changed his equations. They were adaptable. Very practical
to describe a universe of 4 dimensions where one of them is time.
Gravity is just a curvature of that imaginary space that exists only in
the mind of those who study this, quote and quote, “genius”’
ideology.</p>
<p>They also had some pretty interesting consequences. According to the
ideology, if we put a clock on earth and another on a spaceship, let's
remember that the genius could only do experiments on the mind, and the
ship leaves traveling through space and then back to earth, the ship’s
clock will mark a shorter time for the trip than what the earth’s clock
marks. Interesting, right?. Only that it also has other consequences.
According to the ideology, the ship can ALSO say that it is the earth
the one making the trip and from the ship’s point of view it is the
earth’s clock which will mark a shorter time for the trip than what the
ship’s clock marks. Which allows us to conclude that, according to the
ideology, a clock can be faster and slower for the same event than
another clock. Little mathematical contradictions that make it even more
interesting. ABSURD but interesting. The world loved it and it still
does.</p>
<p>When the EXCLUSIVELY attractive force on which his description of the
universe, that of the late 19th century, was not enough to explain the
characteristics of what began to be observed in the 20th century, the
solution was to add more factors. Purely mathematical factors. Factors
that do not correspond to any observable physical reality.</p>
<p>Assuming that we know those distances that we do NOT know, Why don't
galaxies dissolve? Why do they have structure? Why do they move as we
supposedly observe they move? How could they get to form? Easy, put a
factor in that pod. Dark matter. Dark because we can't see it. But I
have to say yes because if I don't, I am finished, and so is my little
job in the theory. That it has to be more than 80% of the total matter
to make it fit?. IT DOESN’T MATTER. Put in that factor. That little
addition of more than 80% of something that, BY DEFINITION, is not
observed anywhere.</p>
<p>Then more questions appeared and they had to be answered with more
factors. Factors that even the famous Internet encyclopedia recognizes
as MORE HYPOTHETICAL. Listen, MORE! Listen well: MORE!. But maybe by the
time you read this they will have removed the “more” just as they have
fixed the page about the Shroud of Turing to make us believe that since
the 13th century people already made negatives of photographies. </p>
<p>More factors had to be added with names like: Dark energy, black
holes, and others. There isn't enough power to explain my universe of
only attractive forces as I want it to be? Put a little factor for dark
energy in it. I can not explain with my model, of only attractive
forces, the distribution of energy in galaxies? Put black holes in it.
ALL black and dark because, BY DEFINITION, they cannot be observed
anywhere. They only exist in the mathematics so that they fit, that is,
in the imagination of those who earn money for studying that which
cannot be observed, but it must be said that yes, that indirectly, that
with great care, that the evidence is there, that only, they, the
experts in the theory understand it, which blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And all of it assuming that we know those distances that we do NOT
know.</p>
<p>But more questions came up. They found currents and electromagnetic
fields that fill all that I thought was empty space? Call it something
else and adapt those equations again because it starts to look more and
more like a universe explainable with electromagnetic theory, the one
that does consider the existence of REPULSIVE forces, a plasma universe,
and not the one I thought it was. They found higher velocities than the
one we had assumed as maximum for electromagnetic waves? Simply DENY it
AS HARD AS YOU CAN and keep your false axiomatic postulate, which was
not evident to anyone, because it is an axiom of the theory and that
little part was not adaptable.</p>
<p>Amazing, right? But that's how we are. The encyclopedia calls it
science and the majority believes it.</p>
<h3 id="fields_DOT_"><span id="anchor-270"></span>Fields.</h3>
<p>Man has developed many fields of study.</p>
<p>Everything begins with the observation of a phenomenon, whatever
calls the attention of human consciousness, then it seeks to measure,
analyze, study the phenomenon, and in most cases, reproduce, repeat the
phenomenon. Then a series of hypotheses, a model, an operation scheme of
the observed phenomenon is formulated. Based on said model, experiments
are made with the phenomenon, to try to verify if the things that the
model predicts will actually happen. In the extent to which the
predictions are successful the model actually works and explains the
observed phenomenon. This cycle and its variants are known as scientific
methods.</p>
<p>The criterion normally used to determine whether a model or theory is
really scientific or not, is that the hypotheses, in which the model or
theory is based on, are falsifiable. Falsifiable means that experiments
that test those hypotheses can have negative results or contrary to what
it was expected to happen.</p>
<p>The criterion raised in this presentation requires one more step. It
is not enough to understand, or believe that it is understood, through a
model or theory, mathematical or not, which has been verified, or
proven, by repeated observation that the predictions it makes about the
phenomenon are met. The criteria in this presentation require not only
verifying the model, or believe that it has been verified, but to create
something new, to build something new, that is useful, usable, by the
human being, an object. Something that allows the human being who does
not know the theory, who knows the mathematical details or not, check
that the theory or model is useful for something. Was the model needed
to create something useful? If the answer is affirmative, the model
begins to be validated according to the criteria of the technical
creativity, the criterion of this presentation.</p>
<p>This condition implies that the object product of the knowledge of a
phenomenon is reproducible, repeatable. That the object of study can be
recreated. Do you study electric fields? This step involves being able
to recreate them at taste. Do you study magnetic fields? This step
involves being able to reproduce them. Do you study the behavior of
stars? Fields of gravity? Galaxies? Elementary particles? Biological
cells? This step implies being able to recreate them, reproduce them,
repeat them at taste starting from the generative or constitutive
elements that explain the model or theory to verify.</p>
<p>This step is not just to replicate the phenomenon, but to build
something new out of it. from its objects of study, something useful and
usable by the human being. Do you study electromagnetic fields and built
a transmitting object and a receiving object of electromagnetic waves to
remotely transmit human messages? Qualify. Do you study elementary
particles but you do NOT build them or build anything new with them that
is useful to the being human? IT DOES NOT QUALIFY. It is a field of
study but it is not a science, a true knowledge.</p>
<p>Mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics, dynamics,
acoustics, organic and inorganic chemistry, aeronautics, all engineering
that build objects: civil, chemical, electrical, mechanical,
metallurgical, materials, computational, medical etc. qualify according
to this criteria because they have allowed to build airplanes, shoes,
cell phones, microscopes, telephones, watches, televisions, hammers,
trains, telescopes, computers, pots, buildings, transistors,
automobiles, satellites, refrigerators, washers, polishers, backhoes,
machines that make machines, factories that use machines made by other
factories to build other OBJECTS.</p>
<p>No field of study in biology, botany, ecology, in medicine, in
zoology, in genetics, neither in astronomy, geology, oceanography, and
many of physics, such as nuclear, quantum science, and cosmology, do not
qualify by this criterion either. They are fields of study, but they do
not qualify as true knowledge, as true science, according to the
criterion of technical creativity.</p>
<p>No model or theory that seeks to explain cell-based systems qualifies
because man has not been able to build a cell, nor reproduce from cells
a system of cells, vegetable, animal or human. However, DO qualify all
theories necessary to build the INSTRUMENTS or OBJECTS used in those
field of study. For example, optics were necessary to build the first
microscope. Qualify.</p>
<p>Neither do purely abstract theories qualify, no purely mathematical
theory qualifies, because despite being necessary for explaining
virtually any modern model or theory that qualify, the objects created
by such models or theories are not concrete, they are not physical, they
are not perceivable through senses.</p>
<h3 id="extraterrestrial_DOT_"><span
id="anchor-271"></span>Extraterrestrial.</h3>
<p>The word "terrestrial" is normally defined as anything that has
origin on this earth, on this planet. So EXTRA-terrestrial is everything
which has no origin on this planet.</p>
<p>Then it can be concluded that, according to what the bible teaches,
neither the Father, neither the Son Jesus Christ, nor the Holy Spirit,
nor the angels, nor Satan and company, nor the Cherubim, nor any
heavenly principality or power is of terrestrial origin. They are all
EXTRA-terrestrial because their origin is NOT from this planet.</p>
<p>The idea of life forms external to this planet seems to start in the
2nd century after Jesus Christ in the fictional book entitled "A True
Story” by Luciano, where the Sun and the Moon seem to be the only
astronomical objects capable of hosting life forms.</p>
<p>However, there is the issue of Unidentified Flying Objects, also
known as UFOs for their acronym.</p>
<p>The first "flying saucers" are observed in the 1940s. A little later,
in 1947, the acronym UFO began to be used. And a few years later the
word “alien” appears in dictionaries due to the use given to it in
novels, now known as science fiction novels.</p>
<p>In the year 2014, facing the Dead Sea with the sun almost at its
zenith, without a cloud in sight, with a completely blue sky, on a trip
that a group made with a Bogotá Colombia parish called “San Juan
Crisóstomo”, three people, among whom I include myself, Jose Luis
Quiroga, we saw what can be called an unidentified flying object, a
UFO.</p>
<p>The event that I personally observed lasted no more than a tenth of a
second, if I had blinked at that moment I wouldn't have seen it. Looking
from west to east, towards the Dead Sea, with the Sun at 95 degrees from
the horizon, a light, as bright as the sun, at 70 degrees from the
horizon, the size of a star, but obviously within the atmosphere since
it was visible on a day without no cloud and with a completely blue sky,
the light stretched like a laser beam style line, from west to east,
until about 20 degrees from the horizon, and then the line of light
disappeared. Kind of like the effect they do in the movie Star Trek with
the spaceship, but a single point of light that stretches until it forms
a line of light that then disappears.</p>
<p>I don't think it was a star, I don't think it was an optical effect,
nor I think it was something astronomical. I think it was an object
built by the human being with technology that has been hidden since it
was invented during World War II.</p>
<p>For me it was nothing more than a confirmation of my personal
research in the issue of unidentified flying objects, more specifically
on “flying saucers”, which I had made early in the decade of the 2000s,
thanks to the Internet network.</p>
<p>My interest in the subject of unidentified flying objects begins
after reading several of the books that purport to explain the
resurrection of Jesus Christ as an event directed or organized by
aliens. Extraterrestrials that are not biblical. They are not about the
creator of heaven and earth, but of a supposed civilization that has its
origin in another part of the heaven of heavens. But if Jesus Christ was
indeed resurrected, the rest of the bible, not just the part that speaks
of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, has to be true, and if that is so,
then the hypothesis that a civilization coming from those lights that we
see in the sky, and that we call stars, was the one that resurrected
Jesus Christ has to be false. The hypothesis may be consistent with a
small part of the gospels but it is not with respect to the whole
bible.</p>
<p>The scientific theory behind the development of this technology is
none other than the good old and well-known "electromagnetic theory" of
Maxwell and Heaviside, the same one behind most of the technologies of
the 20th and 21st century. Nothing unusual.</p>
<p>Since 1911 Nikola Tesla, the inventor of various types of motor and
of the mechanisms of transmission of electrical energy in the form of
alternate currents that are still used all over the planet today, a
practitioner of the electromagnetic theory of Maxwell and Heaviside,
declared in newspapers such as "The Sun" and the "Herald" of New York,
about his design of a flying machine without planes, without wings, or
propellers, shaped like a box, which it can stay static in the air,
which is not affected by the wind, which can also reach speeds above the
speed of sound, because, he claims, he has worked out a dynamic theory
of gravity that will put an end to vain speculations and false
conceptions, like that of curved space, the one of the guy that liked to
stick out his tongue.</p>
<p>In the mid-20th century, Thomas Townsend Brown worked on projects for
the United States Navy in a field of study known as electrogravitics,
which is nothing other than the well-known theory of classical fields,
which relates magnetism and electricity, the theory electromagnetic
fields, but applied to similarly relating gravity and electricity.</p>
<p>It is really not so difficult to imagine the mechanism of
electropropulsion used in early models of a wingless flying machine or
propellers, a flying saucer, if one takes into account that the
potential difference between the atmosphere and the earth is about 400
thousand volts. It’s only needed to charge a capacitor with voltages
higher than that difference and be able to alter said charge at taste.
This capacitor will move between the earth and the atmosphere depending
on the amount of charge it has stored. The movement is controlled by
changing the distribution of the charge on the capacitor, similarly to
as a particle, which electric charge is changing, it is displaced within
an electric field. Where in this case, the electric field is given by
that potential difference between the earth and the atmosphere of 400
thousand volts.</p>
<p>Early models achieved this effect by charging the capacitor with
asymmetric voltage pulses, where the voltage change is faster on the
rise than on the fall, where the maximum voltage of said pulses is less
than 50 thousand volts. The result is that charge is pumped into the
capacitor by applying said pulses with a frequency higher than the rate
at which the capacitor can be discharged. To charge the capacitor, and
to quickly discharge it, the asymmetry in the voltage pulses is
reversed. Asymmetry in high voltage pulses with high frequency allow to
charge and discharge the capacitor. There are several patents from the
last century, from the 20th century, that describe this propulsion
mechanism used since the second world war.</p>
<p>But the development of this technology continued and with the advent
of digital information and its encryption mechanisms, the track of such
development is lost by the end of the 20th century. Only the testimonies
of groups of people who have seen ships, the result of said technology,
or its variants, which can reach gigantic sizes, and have different
forms to the flying saucer of 1947.</p>
<p>One of the most documented sightings of gigantic UFOs are the
“Phoenix Lights”, in 1997, in Arizona. The development of ships like the
observed in Phoenix is financed by the billions of dollars diverted from
innocuous large public projects like the particle accelerators and
so-called research projects in nuclear fusion reactors around the
planet. To achieve this they need no more than 100 thousand people
organized in the form of a para-government, people from a subset of the
planetary military industrial complex, influenced by Satan and company,
with the same greed that affect man since the time of Adam: money,
social power and pleasure. About 100 thousand greedy in control of some
technologies developed in secret since the second world war and that by
now they are almost “vox-populi”.</p>
<p>My speculation about the future, movie style, is that when the event
of the rapture happens, of the chosen ones by the creator God of Heaven
and Earth, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, analyzed in this
presentation, when the return of Jesus Christ begins, and those who will
continue on this planet are temporarily raptured to heaven, while the
rest, those who stayed on earth, kill themselves each other for
survival, the one they think they have to fight for, because they
believe that death is the end, while they kill each other, I repeat, on
a planet that suffers the planetary effects initiated in times of Noah,
earthquakes, wars, pandemics, overpopulation, climate change, lack of
drinking water, lack of food, and the absence of the Holy Spirit in
their minds and hearts that makes them believe that the death is the
end, when said rapture is carried out by the God that doesn't need star
ships to go to the stars, at that time, Satan and company will use these
greedy people to make those who stayed believe that the aliens took the
chosen ones in a mass abduction.</p>
<p>The aliens took them. A half truth if we have into account that
neither our heavenly Father, nor Jesus Christ, nor the Holy Spirit, nor
the angels originate from this planet and are therefore
extraterrestrials. Only that the supposed good guys will be these greedy
people and they will make the pantomime of descending like heroes, with
their fleet of ships, to defend the human race from the evil ones who
took away a part of mankind, causing the world wars announced in the
book of the revelation.</p>
<p>You already know the outcome of the movie if you paid attention to
this presentation when it presented the book of Revelation and the
Return of the Son of the Man, of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3 id="determinism_DOT_"><span id="anchor-272"></span>Determinism.</h3>
<p>The determinism that is accepted in this presentation is the same
that is accepted in any process that allows technical creativity. This
means that said determinism is limited by the capacity of the creator or
user of a technology in predicting or determining the behavior of the
created object.</p>
<p>In the creative processes of the human being there is always a list
of variables that have to be kept within limits for the creation to
actually work. Temperature, pressure, speed, force, area, volume, time,
voltage etc. are some of the variables that limit the working of a
creation. A commercial cell phone does not work at 5000 degrees
centigrade or without a battery. Temperature and voltage limit said
determinism, the behavior determined by the logic of the creation, in
this case a commercial cell phone.</p>
<p>Determinism, that ability to determine the functioning, the
operation, of any creation is limited by the capacity of the PERSON who
exercises it. Determinism is something that is exercised by a PERSON in
the context of a creation, of something created.</p>
<p>In the case of heaven and earth, it is our Creator, the Creator of
the heaven and earth, who establishes and knows said determinism, and
very limitedly the human being as a user of said creation. So what to
the human being it may seem completely indeterminate, as for example the
future, for our creator it’s not.</p>
<p>This conceptual position, in which determinism is a function of
capacities of each PERSON that interacts with a CREATION, it is
different from the most popular conceptual positions. This concept does
not depend only on some material causes, or on a logic, or on a
structure, or on a generative process, much less on statistics, but of
the people who have the capacity to determine something. It is dependent
on the PERSON that interacts with a CREATION. If there is no creation
there is no determinism. If there is no person there is no
determinism.</p>
<p>In the case of the human being, a creature with the ability to
create, happens the case of the acquisition of such determinism. The
human being can learn to reproduce, create, alter, manipulate, predict
something about what someone else has created. The person can acquire
determinism about a CREATION. The person can acquire a TRUTH about a
creation. That change in the human being’s capacity to alter,
manipulate, predict a behavior of something created, either by the man
or by our creator, alters the determinism of said being human.</p>
<p>An example is a month-old baby and his mother. A baby can determine,
within his abilities, where he moves his little arm but cannot determine
the room in which he will sleep tonight. The mother can determine,
within her capabilities, in which room her baby will sleep tonight. And
God can determine, within his capabilities, whether or not the baby is
going to sleep in a room, any room at all, tonight.</p>
<p>Determinism is limited by the capabilities of each PERSON regarding a
CREATION, it is a function of the PERSON and of the CREATED thing.</p>
<p>Thus, for the Creator of Heaven and Earth, the future of Heaven and
Earth are completely determined, established, planned from the
beginning. All men, women, old people and children, even the breastfed,
that have died or are going to die, are perfectly determined to die the
moment they did or will die. And according to the words of Jesus Christ
everyone, absolutely everyone, will be resurrected, both those who did
good and those who did evil. Including those of Amalek who were killed
by Saul following YHWH's orders. All evil is used for good by our
heavenly Father. It's all part of his plan. The rebellion of Satan and
company, Saul's disobedience, the disobedience of all humanity and the
death of Jesus Christ on the Cross for the sins of you, me and the whole
humanity, as well as his resurrection on the 3rd day. It's exactly why
that God is God and left everything written before. He knows the end
from the beginning.</p>
<h1 id="part-4_DOT_-testimony_DOT_"><span id="anchor-273"></span>PART 4.
TESTIMONY.</h1>
<h3 id="my-testimony_DOT_"><span id="anchor-274"></span>My testimony.</h3>
<p>I think my process so far can be summed up in 4 different stages.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Conclude that there must be a superior being.</li>
<li>Believe that Jesus Christ was physically resurrected.</li>
<li>Believe that the entire bible must be true.</li>
<li>Begin to follow Jesus Christ.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three stages were a purely intellectual process. From study
of the bible, of the evidence in favor, of the logic that unites them.
This presentation is the summary of the topics that God put me to study
in order to believe what I believe now.</p>
<p>Coming to believe in the existence of a superior being takes me since
the year 1980 to 1991 approximately. But he was not the creator we read
in the bible, it was simply a force, a universal energy and aware.
Getting to believe that Jesus Christ is risen takes me since 1997 until
2003. And coming to believe that the bible is true takes me until mid
2009. Those were the times that God used in my case.</p>
<p>However, believing in a Creator God, in Jesus Christ and that the
bible is true, it does not imply following Jesus Christ. That fourth
stage only began until January 2017.</p>
<p>I graduated as a computer and systems engineer in 1993. Since year
1998, I dedicate my professional knowledge to research, as an
independent, a practical solution to the mathematical problem known as
the SAT problem, the satisfiability problem. In 2010, I come to the
conclusion that the last strategy, which I had taken more than a year
and a half to implement, it is equivalent to all those that had failed
during those more than 10 years of innocuous efforts. During those more
of 10 years of innocuous efforts the economic sustenance for that
routine, that I have in a room where I sleep and work, comes mainly from
my parents. The same day that I discover said equivalence, and thus the
fundamental reason for my latest failure, while my parents are away on a
weekend trip, I cry in my room on Friday night and ask that Jesus
Christ, that in who I already believe in, for help, but who I didn’t
think was a fundamental part of my existence. The next day, Saturday
morning, I start to think in what would be the ideal conditions that
would allow an effective strategy and I come up with a new strategy in
which I start to work that same day and that I finally finished
implementing it in the year 2016.</p>
<p>The software project is free software under the name of "Ben-Jose
Trainable SAT Solver" on the developers portal "github.com" since 2014,
the year I traveled to Israel, financed largely by my mother. When I
finish, in 2016, I prepare a document that I send to the annual
international conference of people who work on the SAT problem, which
that year was in Bordeaux, France. The document is rejected due to non
content related issues and I cannot participate in the conference. I
finally decide to just leave it as free software.</p>
<p>During all that time I maintain my interest in studying the bible.
However, the SAT problem and studying biblical subjects have not been my
only interest.</p>
<p>Between the year 2000 and the year 2016, between the hours of 5pm and
7pm any day of the week, except Sunday, due to lack of offer, someone
who followed me very carefully could find me in a room in one of the
establishments in the Bogotá neighborhood known as "El Santa Fe", having
paid for the permit to “know”, in the same way that the bible refers to
that word when it says that “Adam knew Eve”, a woman.</p>
<p>That "someone" would have to follow me carefully since I left, in
sweatpants, black boots that I never took off, with a blue jacket
raincoat, and very clean shaven, to take a Transmilenio bus, because it
was not much time that I spent in the streets of the neighborhood, or in
the public areas of the establishments in that neighborhood. The time
was spent in the transport, in a dialogue of no more than two minutes,
and in the "knowing". This despite the fact that to reach the first two
minutes of dialogue, with a woman in particular, who for her could be
the first time she saw me, it could take from a few seconds to even
years of waiting for my experience to tell me the she was ready.
Experience showed me that, in that context, trying to make her ready was
ineffective and a waste of time. It was very important not to fail at
that first opportunity.</p>
<p>I usually did the activity with women I had already met before, with
women that I knew I would get the desired result. Experience has shown
me that if the necessary trust was not achieved in the first chance, the
statistical probability of getting it later was almost nil. The time in
dialogue prior to the first interaction was not an important factor. It
wasn't about knowing her intellectually. On the contrary, if in the
first 3 or 4 interactions the desired result was achieved, the
statistical probability of always repeating it became very high. The
result in those first times, added to the autonomous voice to voice,
were very important for the proper functioning of the system. And
obviously alcohol, violence, the wrong word, and any hurtful reaction,
acted against the proper functioning of the system. It was always
preferable to lick one's wounds at home and not properly praying with
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I was obviously never satisfied and I always wished and sought to
meet a new one, one whose forms were the ones I idolized. Even on many
occasions, I asked God to give me another one, whose shapes were round,
firm, large, whose temperament was the appropriate, and that she was
really ready to get the desired result. Even on several occasions, just
after checking the desired result, I yelled “THANK YOU GOD”. Every move
was coldly calculated and tested by experience with the aim to maximize
the quality and quantity of the desired result.</p>
<p>In my case, the desired result of the interaction was what I believed
it was the proof, the evidence, the guarantee of an acceptance and a
satisfaction that in reality only Jesus Christ can give us. That
evidence, that proof, I believed that, according to Songs 5, it was what
king Solomon also got. King Solomon enters what he calls "his garden".
According to Song of Songs 4, that garden is identified with a bride of
him. Song of Songs 4 speaks about a tongue and lips, but they do not
seem to refer to a mouth but to that garden. Solomon ate honey, and
drank wine and milk.</p>
<p>In my case, I never tried all three products at the same time, but
almost always I drank, I swallowed, I tasted, I swigged, I savored, at
least one of the three. That was my proof, my evidence, my guarantee of
acceptance and of satisfaction. That was my addiction. That was my most
prominent sin, my idolatry, my pride, my obsession, my slavery. That was
my doom, my death, my most prominent deception. Only Jesus Christ fills
us with his acceptance, He satisfies us and makes us truly free.</p>
<p>That sin ends up fulfilling what the deuterocanonical book
Ecclesiasticus 19 says: "the worms will eat him." I thought it meant
what happens to every person after physical death, and therefore I was
not worried, but my experience is much more literal: I had a bacterium
that caused me diarrhea every 15, 20, 30 days. I did different
treatments and obviously none of them worked because none of them fixed
the cause of the problem: my addiction, my sin, my idolatry. I also had
a series of spiritual problems, ones like the Gerasene man or the
Magdalene, that at the time I couldn't even identify.</p>
<p>Thus, what I called, quote and quote, "my life" collapses in the year
2016. I don't have a wife, I don't have children, I don't have a
professional career, I don't have a social network, I live in a room in
the same house as my adolescence, I have no money or material
possessions as a result of my work, I do not have any professional
recognition, I have an addiction, a sin, that is killing me slowly but
surely, and the work to which I dedicated almost 20 years of what I
called, quote and quote, "my life" doesn't seem to interest anyone, not
even the people that I live with.</p>
<p>In that year, I plan my suicide, I plan to take away what I called,
quote and quote, "my life". Deceived by my idolatry, by Satan and by the
world, I did not realize that in reality I was already more dead than
alive. My relationship with The Life, with Jesus Christ, was something
auxiliary, it was something almost inexistent.</p>
<p>Thank God his plans for me are different.</p>
<p>In January 2017 after once again asking Jesus Christ for help, this
time a little more desperate, my process to follow Jesus Christ begins.
Until then, Jesus Christ and the bible were subjects of study. Jesus
Christ was almost outside, it was something almost external, it was not
a fundamental part of what I called "my life", it was an accessory, a
very interesting subject of study, something intellectual. Something
like this presentation for someone who has not started following Jesus
Christ but who already believes in him, or who is only interested in
him: a subject of study.</p>
<p>The congregation I started attending in January 2017 is called "El
Lugar de Su Presencia" And as you may have noticed along this
presentation, there is at least one big difference between: the absolute
reconciliation after the resurrection of the dead, which I give biblical
sustenance in this presentation; and what is taught, not only in "El
Lugar de Su Presencia", but in most western congregations because they
deny it. It is not the same with the Eastern Orthodox congregations,
which do not have as much influence from Augustine and a little more
from Gregory of Nyssa and others <a href="#fn723" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref723" role="doc-noteref"><sup>723</sup></a>, because some accept
it.</p>
<p>Another notable difference is what not only this congregation has,
but many other so-called charismatic or pentecostal ones also have, the
belief that according to the bible "to speak in tongues" means to utter
INCOHERENT groans that each time they are repeated they mean something
different. As if our Creator were a God of confusion.</p>
<p>What the Holy Spirit DID teach me, through the sessions of prayer in
this congregation and daily bible study, it was something completely new
to what I already have explained in this presentation.</p>
<p>In January 2017 I begin to assist every Saturday to what the
congregation calls “connection groups”, to attend prayer every Tuesday
and Thursday at 6am in the main auditorium, to attend preaching on
Saturdays or Sundays, to read the bible every day, not every time I felt
like it, to give up my sin for good and to intentionally seek to think,
speak and act as Jesus Christ taught before his resurrection. I do the
free process of basic Christian formation offered by the congregation,
knowing that there is a possibility that, due to the two issues already
mentioned, maybe not even the main leader would consider me a true
"Christian" acceptable in his congregation. In 2019, once I finished the
training process, I begin to serve as a volunteer in the area of
"Protection and care."</p>
<p>All these activities are just the habits, the customs, that since
January 2017, the Holy Spirit begins to use, to teach me that it is HE
who must reign in my life to be able to identify my enemy and show me
who I am, what my true identity really is. He begins to reign in me and
he starts to transform my mind to really defeat my enemy and live my
true identity, the biblical identity of those who believe in Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>It begins to reign in me and teaches me the way in which the flesh,
sin, impure spirits, evil spirits, the enemy, Satan, very subtly
operates on my mind. Without the Holy Spirit reigning in me, it was
impossible for me to identify it because it works with my own voice.
Before I believed that I was the one who was thinking, speaking, acting
in my mind and couldn't identify it. It is the Holy Spirit that now
reigns in me, at least most of the time, who identifies it and defeats
it.</p>
<p>It was the Holy Spirit, who now reigns in me most of the time, who
identified my enemy, and began the victory in the good fight of which
Paul speaks about. The Holy Spirit began to win the battle against my
enemy, the one who previously had me enslaved and deceived creating my
identity around its image.</p>
<p>The sin, the flesh, Satan, the impure spirits and the evil ones that
are in me: lust, anger, rage, haughtiness, pride, rebellion, sexual
greed, sexual immorality, pornography, idolatry, prostitution, greed for
money, greed for power, depression, the desire to die, sadness, guilt,
condemnation, exaggeration of the truth, denial of the truth, contempt
for the truth, distortion of the truth, fear, panic, fear of dying, fear
of the future, selfishness, all those spirits that oppose the presence
of the Holy Spirit, that oppose to my new identity, I was deceived very
often and very subtly they created an identity to make me believe that I
was that. It is what the bible says that happens to everyone who does
not have Jesus Christ reigning in his heart. He is subtly enslaved. The
Holy Spirit was already in me, it already lived in me, but aside, it was
something accessory, I hadn't crowned him King of my life, He did not
reign in me. Jesus Christ was THE King but not MY King.</p>
<p>The notable victories are just beginning, they started in January of
2017. But many more are missing. I still commit a lot of adultery in the
heart. It still happens to me that I look at, or remember, a woman with
desire. There is still lust in me. Sometimes I still wish, that after
the resurrection of the dead, I could know again, in Jesus Christ, all
the women I desired and knew in sin.</p>
<p>However, there are notable victories. The fire no longer burns as
before. The external symptoms of my lust are almost nil and very
sporadic. That arm that was killing me has already been amputated,
although it still hasn't finished scar.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit of the one who defeated my enemy on the cross, of the
one who placed my enemy under my feet, and that now reigns in me, that
Holy Spirit, can now bind, chain, expel any other impure spirit or evil
that he manages to identify. If it is a spirit of the flesh, he can nail
to the cross and if it is not of the flesh he can throw it into the
eternal fire and into the abyss. It is something spiritual. It is thanks
to that identity in Christ Jesus, who now reigns in me most of the time,
that I can defeat my enemy. Those heavenly principalities and powers
that Paul speaks about.</p>
<p>Now I can identify my enemy and defeat him.</p>
<p>The bible says that I am a son of God, because the son of God lives
in me. It says that I am accepted, because the accepted of God lives in
me. It says that I am loved by God, because the beloved of God lives in
me. That I am worthy, because the worthy lives in me. That I am joint
heir of the kingdom of heaven, because the heir lives in me. It says
that I am more than victorious, because the victorious over the world
lives in me. It says I'm good, because the good one lives in me. It says
that I am forgiven because the good one died for my sins. It says that
in me there is no longer guilt or condemnation because Jesus Christ died
for me, he rose again, and God declares me free from guilt. It says that
I am no longer slave of fear because love casts out fear. It says that
Jesus Christ will be with me every day until the end of the world. It
says that I am free because the Son of Man has truly made me free. It
says that I am a Saint because the Saint lives in me. It says I'm Just
because the Just lives in me. It says that I am an ambassador of the
kingdom of heavens here on earth. It says that I am protected and
protector because the protector lives in me. It says that I am comforted
and comforter because the comforter lives in me. It says that I can love
because his love overflows in me. It says that I can forgive because I
was forgiven. It says that now I have a peace that surpasses all
understanding because Jesus Christ gave that peace to me. It says that
now I have a joy that no one can take away from me because Jesus Christ
was resurrected. It says that now I have the Joy of the Holy Spirit in
me. It says that I am humble because the humble lives in me. It says
that I am Faithful because the Faithful lives in me. It says that I am
powerful because the spirit that resurrected Jesus Christ lives in me.
It says that the old things have passed away and they have all been made
new. It says that I am a new creature in Christ Jesus. It says that I no
longer live but now Jesus Christ lives in me. It says that I have
eternal life because the eternal King lives in me. It says that he
disposes all things for my good because I love him. It says that neither
suffering, nor hardship, nor persecution, nor famine, nor lack of
clothing, neither danger nor death will be able to separate me from the
love of Jesus Christ. It says that neither life nor death, neither
angels nor spiritual powers, neither things present nor things to come,
neither height nor deep, nor anything created by God will be able to
separate me from the love of God displayed in Jesus Christ. That nothing
can separate me from his love. It says that I am his beloved son and
that he will not cast me out.</p>
<p>THAT IS WHO I AM. THAT IS MY IDENTITY. I have already started living
it. I AM NEW CREATURE, the old things have passed away behold ALL things
are made new.</p>
<p>So I'm just a baby in Jesus Christ, I'm just beginning to really know
him, I'm just starting to follow him, but I'm already crawling on the
right direction.</p>
<h3 id="and-you"><span id="anchor-275"></span>And you?</h3>
<p>Obviously assuming the identity in Jesus Christ is impossible if you
don't believe that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is a Creator, designer and intelligent, of all plants, animals
and people on this planet.</li>
<li>Jesus Christ is alive because, after dying on the cross, the Creator
raised him on the third day.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can try to convince yourself, but Jesus Christ warns that:
<strong>”<strong>N</strong>o one can come to me unless the Father who
sent me” <a href="#fn724" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref724"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>724</sup></a> “drag<strong>s</strong>
<strong>him </strong>first” <a href="#fn725" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref725" role="doc-noteref"><sup>725</sup></a></strong> and
explains that: <strong>“What is IMPOSSIBLE for mere humans is possible
for God” <a href="#fn726" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref726"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>726</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>And you?. Do you already believe it? Has the eternal fire already
begun to burn? Do you want to start living?</p>
<p>Acknowledge your sin, repent, and ask Jesus Christ to come and live
in you. Tell him that you accept him as your God, your King, your Lord
and Savior. Tell him that you believe he died for you on the cross and
he was resurrected on the third day, according to the scriptures that
promised that it would happen.</p>
<p>Once you do this, you should know that you could do it because YHWH
is being faithful and fulfilling his promise to give you a new heart,
one circumcised, so that you only have the will to love him above all
things, for your own good, because he does not want the sinner to die
but to repent and live forever.</p>
<p>You already did it, but: There is no victory? You can't identify your
enemy? You can't defeat your enemy? Are you still dying?</p>
<p>Tell Jesus Christ that you want him to be the King of your life and
crown him as the King of your life. Make Jesus Christ the King of your
life and he will begin to defeat your enemy, the one who have you
enslaved very subtly.</p>
<p>Does the eternal fire continue to burn?</p>
<p>Jesus Christ explains to us in John 15: <strong>“I am the vine. You
are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit,
for apart from me you can do NOTHING. If a man doesn’t remain in me, he
is thrown out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them, throw
them into the FIRE, and they are burned” <a href="#fn727"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref727"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>727</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>We must remain united to Jesus Christ ALL the days of our eternal
life and give thanks to the Eternal Father because it is his Holy
Spirit, that He gave us, the one who really leads us to think all the
good that we think, say all the good things that we say, and do all the
good things we do, including remaining with him and thanking him for
making us new creatures. Because: <strong>“who has first given to him,
and it will be repaid to him again? For of him, and through him, and to
him are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen” <a href="#fn728"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref728"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>728</sup></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Be fire, it is the only way not to burn in the eternal fire.</p>
