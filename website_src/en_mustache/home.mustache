    <p>If you want a synopsis, it is this:
    <p>The bible teaches about a physical resurrection, for ALL the dead, in a new physical body, which cannot die, on a new physical earth with a new physical heavens, AFTER the present earth and heavens are destroyed by a physical fire, to live eternally in the midst of an eternal love that acts like an ETERNAL FIRE that consumes, that transforms, the mind and heart of the sinner, that you and I are, destroying, ending, vanishing, to the point that they will search for it and will not find it, the sin, the lies, the spiritual death, in which we are born, because we are not born with a personal relationship with the Creator, and it transforms us into a new creature, a new person, with a new mind, with a new heart, who can love our Creator with all his mind, with all his heart and with all his strength, and his neighbor as himself, and come to know Him in the person of Jesus Christ, and in this way truly transform us into creatures in the image of our Creator: good, holy, just, complete like his Only Begotten Son: Jesus Christ. To this process of transformation, it calls it "salvation" and it is for ALL FLESH.
