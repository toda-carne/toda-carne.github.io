    <p>If you want a synopsis, it is this:</p>
    <p>The bible teaches about a physical resurrection, for ALL the dead, in a new physical body, which cannot die, on a new physical earth with a new physical heavens, AFTER the present earth and heavens are destroyed by a physical fire, to live eternally thanks to an eternal love, a holy spirit, that acts like an ETERNAL FIRE that consumes, that transforms, the mind and heart of the sinner, that you and I are, allowing us to repent of our sin, to believe in Jesus Christ, to trust Him, and that way start to destroy, end, vanish, to the point that we will search for it and we will not find it, the sin, the lies, the spiritual death, in which we are born, because we are not born with a personal relationship with the Creator, and in that way it transforms us from an enemy of the Creator into a new creature, a new person, one that has been born again in the spirit, with a new mind, with a new heart, who can love our Creator with all his mind, with all his heart and with all his strength, and his neighbor as himself, and come to know Him in the person of Jesus Christ, and thus truly transform us into creatures in the image of our Creator: good, holy, just, complete like his Only Begotten Son Jesus Christ. To this process of spiritual transformation, that can start before or after the physical resurrection, it calls it "salvation" and it is for ALL FLESH.</p>
