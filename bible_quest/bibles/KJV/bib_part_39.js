      "3": "And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;",
      "4": "And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; ",
      "5": "I have made the earth, the man and the beast that  are  upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.",
      "6": "And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.",
      "7": "And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.",
      "8": "And it shall come to pass,  that  the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.",
      "9": "Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: ",
      "10": "For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.",
      "11": "But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein. ",
      "12": "I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.",
      "13": "Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?",
      "14": "Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.",

      "2": "Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.",
      "3": "Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: ",
      "4": "And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. ",
      "5": "Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,",
      "6": "Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.",
      "7": "Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;",
      "8": "The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.",
      "9": "The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass,  then  shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him. ",
      "10": "Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and brake it.",
      "11": "And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.",
      "12": "Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah  the prophet , after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,",
      "13": "Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.",
      "14": "For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.",
      "15": "Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.",
      "16": "Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD. ",

      "3": "By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,",
      "4": "Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;",

      "9": "For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD. ",
      "10": "For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.",

      "17": "Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.",
      "18": "And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them: ",
      "19": "Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending  them ; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.",
      "20": "Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:",

      "23": "Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and  am  a witness, saith the LORD. ",
      "24": " Thus  shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, ",

      "26": "The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man  that is  mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.",
      "27": "Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?",
      "28": "For therefore he sent unto us  in  Babylon, saying, This  captivity is  long: build ye houses, and dwell  in them ; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.",
