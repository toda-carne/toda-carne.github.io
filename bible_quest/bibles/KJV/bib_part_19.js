      "8": "And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat,  There is  yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.",
      "9": "Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten  hither  Micaiah the son of Imlah. ",
      "10": "And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. ",

      "32": "And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it  is  the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.",
      "33": "And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it  was  not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.",
      "34": "And a  certain  man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.   ",
      "35": "And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.  ",
      "36": "And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.",
      "37": "So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. ",
      "38": "And  one  washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.",

      "43": "And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing  that which was  right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away;  for  the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.",
      "44": "And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.",

      "46": "And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.",
      "47": " There was  then no king in Edom: a deputy  was  king.",
      "48": "Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber. ",
      "49": "Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.",
      "50": "And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.",
      "51": "Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.",
      "52": "And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:",
      "53": "For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done. "

      "3": "But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them,  Is it  not because  there is  not a God in Israel,  that  ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?",
      "4": "Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed. ",
      "5": "And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?",
      "6": "And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD,  Is it  not because  there is  not a God in Israel,  that  thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.",
      "7": "And he said unto them, What manner of man  was he  which came up to meet you, and told you these words? ",
      "8": "And they answered him,  He was  an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It  is  Elijah the Tishbite. ",
      "9": "Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.",
      "10": "And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I  be  a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.",
      "11": "Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.",
      "12": "And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I  be  a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.",
      "13": "And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.

      "14": "Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.",
      "15": "And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.",
