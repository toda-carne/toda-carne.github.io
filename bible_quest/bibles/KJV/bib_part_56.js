      "5": "Whose  are  the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ  came , who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen. ",
      "6": "Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they  are  not all Israel, which are of Israel:",
      "7": "Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham,  are they  all children: but,  In Isaac shall thy seed be called. ",
      "8": "That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these  are  not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.",
      "9": "For this  is  the word of promise,  At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son. ",

      "14": "What shall we say then?  Is there  unrighteousness with God? God forbid.",
      "15": "For he saith to Moses,  I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. ",
      "16": "So then  it is  not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.",
      "17": "For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh,  Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. ",

      "3": "For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.",
      "4": "For Christ  is  the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.",
      "5": "For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,  That the man which doeth those things shall live by them. ",
      "6": "But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,  Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?  (that is, to bring Christ down  from above :)",

      "9": "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.",
      "10": "For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.",
      "11": "For the scripture saith,  Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  ",
      "12": "For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.",
      "13": " For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. ",
      "14": "How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?",
      "15": "And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written,  How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things! ",
      "16": "But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,  Lord, who hath believed our report?   ",

      "3": " Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life. ",
      "4": "But what saith the answer of God unto him?  I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to  the image of  Baal. ",
      "5": "Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.",
      "6": "And if by grace, then  is it  no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if  it be  of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.",
      "7": "What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded ",

      "10": " Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway. ",
      "11": "I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but  rather  through their fall salvation  is come  unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.",
      "12": "Now if the fall of them  be  the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? ",
      "13": "For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:",
      "14": "If by any means I may provoke to emulation  them which are  my flesh, and might save some of them.",
      "15": "For if the casting away of them  be  the reconciling of the world, what  shall  the receiving  of them be , but life from the dead?",
      "16": "For if the firstfruit  be  holy, the lump  is  also  holy : and if the root  be  holy, so  are  the branches.",
      "17": "And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; ",
      "18": "Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.",
      "19": "Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.",
      "20": "Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:",
      "21": "For if God spared not the natural branches,  take heed  lest he also spare not thee.",
      "22": "Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in  his  goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.",
      "23": "And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.",
      "24": "For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural  branches , be graffed into their own olive tree?",
      "25": "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. ",
      "26": "And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written,  There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: ",
      "27": " For this  is  my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. ",
      "28": "As concerning the gospel,  they are  enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election,  they are  beloved for the fathers' sakes.",
      "29": "For the gifts and calling of God  are  without repentance.",
      "30": "For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: ",
      "31": "Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. ",
      "32": "For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.  ",
