      "1": "Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, ",
      "2": "Saul chose him three thousand  men  of Israel;  whereof  two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.",
      "3": "And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that  was  in Geba, and the Philistines heard  of it . And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. ",
      "4": "And all Israel heard say  that  Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and  that  Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. ",
      "5": "And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which  is  on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.",
      "6": "When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.",
      "7": "And  some of  the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he  was  yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.  ",
      "8": "And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel  had appointed : but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him.",
      "9": "And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.",
      "10": "And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. ",
      "11": "And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and  that  thou camest not within the days appointed, and  that  the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash;",
      "12": "Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. ",
      "13": "And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.",
      "14": "But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him  to be  captain over his people, because thou hast not kept  that  which the LORD commanded thee. ",
      "15": "And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people  that were  present with him, about six hundred men. ",
      "16": "And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people  that were  present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.  ",
      "17": "And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way  that leadeth to  Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:",
      "18": "And another company turned the way  to  Bethhoron: and another company turned  to  the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.",
      "19": "Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make  them  swords or spears:",
      "20": "But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.",
      "21": "Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.  ",
      "22": "So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that  were  with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.",
      "23": "And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.  "
    },
    "14": {
      "1": "Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that  is  on the other side. But he told not his father. ",
      "2": "And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which  is  in Migron: and the people that  were  with him  were  about six hundred men;",
      "3": "And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. ",
      "4": "And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison,  there was  a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one  was  Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.",
      "5": "The forefront of the one  was  situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah. ",
      "6": "And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for  there is  no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.",
      "7": "And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that  is  in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I  am  with thee according to thy heart.",
      "8": "Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto  these  men, and we will discover ourselves unto them.",
      "9": "If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. ",
      "10": "But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this  shall be  a sign unto us.",
      "11": "And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.",
      "12": "And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.",
      "13": "And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him.",
      "14": "And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land,  which  a yoke  of oxen might plow . ",
      "15": "And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.  ",
      "16": "And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down  one another .",
      "17": "Then said Saul unto the people that  were  with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer  were  not  there .",
      "18": "And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.",
      "19": "And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that  was  in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. ",
      "20": "And Saul and all the people that  were  with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow,  and there was  a very great discomfiture. ",
      "21": "Moreover the Hebrews  that  were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp  from the country  round about, even they also  turned  to be with the Israelites that  were  with Saul and Jonathan.",
      "22": "Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim,  when  they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.",
      "23": "So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven. ",
      "24": "And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed  be  the man that eateth  any  food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted  any  food.",
      "25": "And all  they of  the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground.",
      "26": "And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.",
      "27": "But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that  was  in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.",
      "28": "Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed  be  the man that eateth  any  food this day. And the people were faint. ",
      "29": "Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey.",
      "30": "How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?",
      "31": "And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint.",
      "32": "And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew  them  on the ground: and the people did eat  them  with the blood.",
      "33": "Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day. ",
      "34": "And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay  them  here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew  them  there. ",
      "35": "And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD.  ",
      "36": "And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.",
      "37": "And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.",
      "38": "And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. ",
      "39": "For,  as  the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But  there was  not a man among all the people  that  answered him.",
      "40": "Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.",
      "41": "Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect  lot . And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.  ",
      "42": "And Saul said, Cast  lots  between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.",
      "43": "Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that  was  in mine hand,  and , lo, I must die.",
      "44": "And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.",
      "45": "And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid:  as  the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.",
      "46": "Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. ",
      "47": "So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed  them .",
      "48": "And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. ",
      "49": "Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters  were these ; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:",
      "50": "And the name of Saul's wife  was  Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host  was  Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. ",
      "51": "And Kish  was  the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner  was  the son of Abiel.",
      "52": "And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him. "

    "15": {
      "1": "Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee  to be  king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.",
      "2": "Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember  that  which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid  wait  for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.",
      "3": "Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.",
      "4": "And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.",
      "5": "And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. ",
      "6": "And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.",
      "7": "And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah  until  thou comest to Shur, that  is  over against Egypt.",
      "8": "And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.",
      "9": "But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all  that was  good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing  that was  vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.  ",
      "10": "Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,",
      "11": "It repenteth me that I have set up Saul  to be  king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.",
      "12": "And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.",
      "13": "And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed  be  thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.",
      "14": "And Samuel said, What  meaneth  then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?",
      "15": "And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.",
      "16": "Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.",
      "17": "And Samuel said, When thou  wast  little in thine own sight,  wast  thou not  made  the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?",
      "18": "And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. ",
      "19": "Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?",
      "20": "And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.",
      "21": "But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.",
      "22": "And Samuel said, Hath the LORD  as great  delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey  is  better than sacrifice,  and  to hearken than the fat of rams.",
      "23": "For rebellion  is as  the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness  is as  iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from  being  king.  ",
      "24": "And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.",
      "25": "Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.",
      "26": "And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.",
      "27": "And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.",
      "28": "And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine,  that is  better than thou.",
      "29": "And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he  is  not a man, that he should repent. ",
      "30": "Then he said, I have sinned:  yet  honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.",
      "31": "So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD. ",
      "32": "Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.",
      "33": "And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.",
      "34": "Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.",
      "35": "And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. "
    },
    "16": {
      "1": "And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.",
      "2": "And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear  it , he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. ",
      "3": "And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me  him  whom I name unto thee.",
      "4": "And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? ",
      "5": "And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. ",
      "6": "And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed  is  before him. ",
      "7": "But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for  the LORD seeth  not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. ",
      "8": "Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.",
      "9": "Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.",
      "10": "Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.",
      "11": "And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all  thy  children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. ",
      "12": "And he sent, and brought him in. Now he  was  ruddy,  and  withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this  is  he. ",
      "13": "Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. ",
      "14": "But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. ",
      "15": "And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.",
      "16": "Let our lord now command thy servants,  which are  before thee, to seek out a man,  who is  a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.",
      "17": "And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring  him  to me.",
      "18": "Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite,  that is  cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD  is  with him. ",
      "19": "Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which  is  with the sheep.",
      "20": "And Jesse took an ass  laden  with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent  them  by David his son unto Saul.",
      "21": "And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.",
      "22": "And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.",
      "23": "And it came to pass, when the  evil  spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. "

    "17": {
      "1": "Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which  belongeth  to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim. ",
      "2": "And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. ",
      "3": "And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and  there was  a valley between them.",
      "4": "And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height  was  six cubits and a span.",
      "5": "And  he had  an helmet of brass upon his head, and he  was  armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat  was  five thousand shekels of brass. ",
      "6": "And  he had  greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders. ",
      "7": "And the staff of his spear  was  like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head  weighed  six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.",
      "8": "And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set  your  battle in array?  am  not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.",
      "9": "If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.",
      "10": "And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.",
      "11": "When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. ",
      "12": "Now David  was  the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name  was  Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men  for  an old man in the days of Saul.",
      "13": "And the three eldest sons of Jesse went  and  followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle  were  Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.",
      "14": "And David  was  the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.",
      "15": "But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.",
      "16": "And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.",
      "17": "And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched  corn , and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;",
      "18": "And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of  their  thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.  ",
      "19": "Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel,  were  in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.",
      "20": "And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.  ",
      "21": "For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.",
      "22": "And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.  ",
      "23": "And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard  them .",
      "24": "And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. ",
      "25": "And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be,  that  the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.",
      "26": "And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who  is  this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?",
      "27": "And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.",
      "28": "And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?

And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. ",
      "16": "Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?",
      "17": "And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour,  even  to David:  ",
      "18": "Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day.",
      "19": "Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow  shalt  thou and thy sons  be  with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. ",
      "20": "Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. ",
      "21": "And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.",
      "22": "Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.",
      "23": "But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.",
      "24": "And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded  it , and did bake unleavened bread thereof:",
      "25": "And she brought  it  before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night. "

      "1": "Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which  is  in Jezreel.",
      "2": "And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.",
      "3": "Then said the princes of the Philistines, What  do  these Hebrews  here ? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines,  Is  not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell  unto me  unto this day?",
      "4": "And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master?  should it  not  be  with the heads of these men?",
      "5": " Is  not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands? ",
      "6": "Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely,  as  the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host  is  good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not. ",
      "7": "Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines. ",
      "8": "And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king? ",
      "9": "And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou  art  good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.",
      "10": "Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.",
      "11": "So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel. "
