      "5": "When they heard  this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.",

      "30": "And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.",
      "31": "And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring  him  that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.",
      "32": "Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.",

      "34": "But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great  is  Diana of the Ephesians.",
      "35": "And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said,  Ye  men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the  image  which fell down from Jupiter? ",
      "36": "Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.",
      "37": "For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.",
      "38": "Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another. ",
      "39": "But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly. ",
      "40": "For we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.",

      "17": "And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.",
      "18": "And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,",
      "19": "Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:",

      "26": "Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I  am  pure from the blood of all  men .",
      "27": "For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.",
      "28": "Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.",
