      "11": "So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about  it  once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.",
      "12": "And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.",
      "13": "And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD,  the priests  going on, and blowing with the trumpets.",
      "14": "And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.",
      "15": "And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.",
      "16": "And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city. ",
      "17": "And the city shall be accursed,  even  it, and all that  are  therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that  are  with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. ",
      "18": "And ye, in any wise keep  yourselves  from the accursed thing, lest ye make  yourselves  accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.  ",
      "19": "But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,  are  consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD. ",
      "20": "So the people shouted when  the priests  blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. ",
      "21": "And they utterly destroyed all that  was  in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.",
      "22": "But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.",
      "23": "And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. ",
      "24": "And they burnt the city with fire, and all that  was  therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.",
      "25": "And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel  even  unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.",
      "26": "And Joshua adjured  them  at that time, saying, Cursed  be  the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest  son  shall he set up the gates of it.",
      "27": "So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was  noised  throughout all the country. "
