      "36": "For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.",
      "37": "And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?",
      "38": "Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?",

      "13": "Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.",
      "14": "And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth.",
      "15": "For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.",
      "16": "And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.",
      "17": "And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;",
      "18": "And saw him saying unto me,  Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me. ",
      "19": "And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee:",
      "20": "And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.",
      "21": "And he said unto me,  Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.  ",
      "22": "And they gave him audience unto this word, and  then  lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a  fellow  from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.",

      "24": "The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.",
      "25": "And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?",
      "26": "When the centurion heard  that , he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.",
      "27": "Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.",
      "28": "And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was  free  born.",
      "29": "Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. ",
      "30": " On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from  his  bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them. "

      "3": "Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee,  thou  whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?",
      "4": "And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?",
      "5": "Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written,  Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.  ",
      "6": "But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men  and  brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.",
      "7": "And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.",
      "8": "For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.",
      "9": "And there arose a great cry: and the scribes  that were  of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.",

      "11": "And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said,  Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.  ",
      "12": "And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. ",
      "13": "And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.",
      "14": "And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.",
      "15": "Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.",
      "16": "And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.",
      "17": "Then Paul called one of the centurions unto  him , and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.",
      "18": "So he took him, and brought  him  to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto  him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.",
      "19": "Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went  with him  aside privately, and asked  him , What is that thou hast to tell me?",

      "4": "Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.",
      "5": "For we have found this man  a  pestilent  fellow , and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:",
      "6": "Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.",

      "19": "But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.",
