      "16": "Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.",
      "17": "For he testifieth,  Thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec. ",
      "18": "For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.",
      "19": "For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope  did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God. ",
      "20": "And inasmuch as not without an oath  he was made priest :",
      "21": "(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him,  The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou  art  a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec: ) ",

      "25": "Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. ",
      "26": "For such an high priest became us,  who is  holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;",
      "27": "Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.",
      "28": "For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law,  maketh  the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.  "

      "2": "A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man. ",
      "3": "For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore  it is  of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.",
      "4": "For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law: ",
      "5": "Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for,  See,  saith he,   that  thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.  ",
      "6": "But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises. ",

      "8": "For finding fault with them, he saith,  Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah: ",
      "9": " Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. ",
      "10": " For this  is  the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:   ",
      "11": " And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest. ",
      "12": " For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more. ",

      "3": "And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;",
      "4": "Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein  was  the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;",
      "5": "And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.",
      "6": "Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service  of God .",
      "7": "But into the second  went  the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and  for  the errors of the people: ",
      "8": "The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:",
      "9": "Which  was  a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;",
      "10": " Which stood  only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed  on them  until the time of reformation. ",
      "11": "But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;",
      "12": "Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption  for us .",
      "13": "For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:",
      "14": "How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?  ",
      "15": "And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions  that were  under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.",
      "16": "For where a testament  is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator. ",
      "17": "For a testament  is  of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.",
      "18": "Whereupon neither the first  testament  was dedicated without blood. ",
      "19": "For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, ",
      "20": "Saying,  This  is  the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. ",
      "21": "Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.",
      "22": "And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission. ",
      "23": " It was  therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.",
      "24": "For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,  which are  the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:",
      "25": "Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;",
      "26": "For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.",
      "27": "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:",
      "28": "So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. "

      "3": "But in those  sacrifices there is  a remembrance again  made  of sins every year.",
      "4": "For  it is  not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.",

      "6": " In burnt offerings and  sacrifices  for sin thou hast had no pleasure.  ",

      "10": "By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once  for all .",
      "11": "And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:",
      "12": "But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;",
      "13": "From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.",
      "14": "For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.",
      "15": " Whereof  the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,",
      "16": " This  is  the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; ",
      "17": " And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.  ",
      "18": "Now where remission of these  is, there is  no more offering for sin. ",
      "19": "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, ",

      "23": "Let us hold fast the profession of  our  faith without wavering; (for he  is  faithful that promised;)",
      "24": "And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:",
      "25": "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some  is ; but exhorting  one another : and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.",
      "26": "For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,",

      "29": "Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?",
      "30": "For we know him that hath said,  Vengeance  belongeth  unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord.  And again,  The Lord shall judge his people. ",

      "32": "But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;",
      "33": "Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.",
      "34": "For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.",
      "35": "Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.",
      "36": "For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.",
      "37": " For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. ",
