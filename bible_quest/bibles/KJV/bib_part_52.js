      "5": "Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.",
      "6": "Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with  his  journey, sat thus on the well:  and  it was about the sixth hour.",
      "7": "There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her,  Give me to drink. ",
      "8": "(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)",
      "9": "Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.",
      "10": "Jesus answered and said unto her,  If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. ",
      "11": "The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?",
      "12": " Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?",
      "13": "Jesus answered and said unto her,  Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: ",
      "14": " But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. ",
      "15": "The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.",
      "16": "Jesus saith unto her,  Go, call thy husband, and come hither. ",
      "17": "The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her,  Thou hast well said, I have no husband: ",
      "18": " For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. ",
      "19": "The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.",
      "20": "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.",
      "21": "Jesus saith unto her,  Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. ",
      "22": " Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. ",
      "23": " But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. ",
      "24": " God  is  a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship  him  in spirit and in truth. ",
      "25": "The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.",

      "27": "And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?",
      "28": "The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,",
      "29": "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?",
      "30": "Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.",
      "31": " In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.",
      "32": "But he said unto them,  I have meat to eat that ye know not of. ",
      "33": "Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him  ought  to eat?",
      "34": "Jesus saith unto them,  My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. ",
      "35": " Say not ye, There are yet four months, and  then  cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. ",
      "36": " And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. ",
      "37": " And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. ",
      "38": " I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. ",
      "39": "And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.",

      "41": "And many more believed because of his own word;",
      "42": "And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard  him  ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. ",
      "43": "Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.",
      "44": "For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.",
      "45": "Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.",
      "46": "So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. ",
      "47": "When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.",
      "48": "Then said Jesus unto him,  Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. ",
      "49": "The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.",
      "50": "Jesus saith unto him,  Go thy way; thy son liveth.  And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.",
      "51": "And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told  him , saying, Thy son liveth.",
      "52": "Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.",
      "53": "So the father knew that  it was  at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him,  Thy son liveth:  and himself believed, and his whole house.",
      "54": "This  is  again the second miracle  that  Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. "

      "1": "After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep  market  a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. ",
      "3": "In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.",
      "4": "For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.",
      "5": "And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.",
      "6": "When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time  in that case , he saith unto him,  Wilt thou be made whole? ",
      "7": "The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.",
      "8": "Jesus saith unto him,  Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. ",
      "9": "And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.",
      "10": "The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry  thy  bed.",
      "11": "He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,  Take up thy bed, and walk. ",
      "12": "Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee,  Take up thy bed, and walk? ",
      "13": "And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in  that  place. ",
      "14": "Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,  Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. ",
      "15": "The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.",
      "16": "And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. ",
      "17": "But Jesus answered them,  My Father worketh hitherto, and I work. ",
      "18": "Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.",
      "19": "Then answered Jesus and said unto them,  Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. ",
      "20": " For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. ",
      "21": " For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth  them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. ",
      "22": " For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: ",
      "23": " That all  men  should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. ",
      "24": " Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. ",
      "25": " Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. ",
      "26": " For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; ",
      "27": " And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. ",
      "28": " Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, ",
      "29": " And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. ",
      "30": " I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.  ",
      "31": " If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. ",
      "32": " There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. ",
      "33": " Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. ",
      "34": " But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. ",
      "35": " He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. ",
      "36": " But I have greater witness than  that  of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. ",
      "37": " And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. ",

      "44": " How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that  cometh  from God only? ",
      "45": " Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is  one  that accuseth you,  even  Moses, in whom ye trust. ",
