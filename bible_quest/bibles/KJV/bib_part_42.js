      "2": "Before the length of an hundred cubits  was  the north door, and the breadth  was  fifty cubits.",
      "3": "Over against the twenty  cubits  which  were  for the inner court, and over against the pavement which  was  for the utter court,  was  gallery against gallery in three  stories .",
      "4": "And before the chambers  was  a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.",
      "5": "Now the upper chambers  were  shorter: for the galleries were higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.  ",
      "6": "For they  were  in three  stories , but had not pillars as the pillars of the courts: therefore  the building  was straitened more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.",
      "7": "And the wall that  was  without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof  was  fifty cubits.",
      "8": "For the length of the chambers that  were  in the utter court  was  fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple  were  an hundred cubits.",
      "9": "And from under these chambers  was  the entry on the east side, as one goeth into them from the utter court.   ",
      "10": "The chambers  were  in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the building.",
      "11": "And the way before them  was  like the appearance of the chambers which  were  toward the north, as long as they,  and  as broad as they: and all their goings out  were  both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.",
      "12": "And according to the doors of the chambers that  were  toward the south  was  a door in the head of the way,  even  the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.",
      "13": "Then said he unto me, The north chambers  and  the south chambers, which  are  before the separate place, they  be  holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place  is  holy.",
      "14": "When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy  place  into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they  are  holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to  those things  which  are  for the people. ",
      "15": "Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect  is  toward the east, and measured it round about.",
      "16": "He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about. ",
      "17": "He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.",
      "18": "He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed.",
      "19": "He turned about to the west side,  and  measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.",
      "20": "He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred  reeds  long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place. "
