      "1": "And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing  them  in  their  hands.",
      "2": "And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?",
      "3": "And Jesus answering them said,  Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; ",
      "4": " How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone? ",
      "5": "And he said unto them, That  the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. ",
      "6": "And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.",
      "7": "And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.",
      "8": "But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand,  Rise up, and stand forth in the midst.  And he arose and stood forth.",
      "9": "Then said Jesus unto them,  I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy  it ? ",
      "10": "And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,  Stretch forth thy hand.  And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.",
      "11": "And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus. ",
      "12": "And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.",
      "13": "And when it was day, he called  unto him  his disciples: and of them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;",

      "17": "And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;",
      "18": "And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed.",
      "19": "And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed  them  all. ",
      "20": "And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said,  Blessed  be ye  poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. ",
      "21": " Blessed  are ye  that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed  are ye  that weep now: for ye shall laugh. ",

      "24": " But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation. ",
      "25": " Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. ",
      "26": " Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.  ",
      "27": " But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, ",
      "28": " Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. ",
      "29": " And unto him that smiteth thee on the  one  cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not  to take thy  coat also. ",
      "30": "  Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask  them  not again. ",
      "31": " And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise. ",
      "32": " For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them. ",
      "33": " And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same. ",
      "34": " And if ye lend  to them  of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again. ",
      "35": " But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and  to  the evil. ",

      "37": "  Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: ",
      "38": " Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. ",
      "39": "And he spake a parable unto them,  Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch? ",
      "40": " The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.  ",
      "41": " And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? ",
      "42": " Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye. ",
      "43": " For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. ",
      "44": " For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.  ",
      "45": " A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh. ",
      "46": " And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? ",
      "47": " Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: ",
      "48": " He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. ",
      "49": " But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.  "

      "3": "And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.",
      "4": "And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:",
      "5": "For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.",
      "6": "Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:",
      "7": "Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.",
      "8": "For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth  it . ",
      "9": "When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him,  I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. ",
      "10": "And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick. ",
      "11": "And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.",
      "12": "Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.",
      "13": "And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her,  Weep not. ",
      "14": "And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare  him  stood still. And he said,  Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.  ",
      "15": "And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.",
      "16": "And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.",
      "17": "And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.",
      "18": "And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. ",
      "19": "And John calling  unto him  two of his disciples sent  them  to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?",
      "20": "When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?",
      "21": "And in that same hour he cured many of  their  infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many  that were  blind he gave sight.",

      "23": " And blessed is  he , whosoever shall not be offended in me. ",
      "24": "And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John,  What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? ",
      "25": " But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts. ",
      "26": " But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. ",
      "27": " This is  he , of whom it is written,  Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.  ",
      "28": " For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. ",
      "29": "And all the people that heard  him , and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.",
      "30": "But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.  ",
      "31": "And the Lord said,  Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? ",

      "38": "And stood at his feet behind  him  weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe  them  with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed  them  with the ointment.",
      "39": "Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw  it , he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman  this is  that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.",
      "40": "And Jesus answering said unto him,  Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.  And he saith, Master, say on.",
      "41": " There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. ",
      "42": " And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? ",
      "43": "Simon answered and said, I suppose that  he , to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him,  Thou hast rightly judged. ",
      "44": "And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon,  Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped  them  with the hairs of her head. ",
      "45": " Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. ",
      "46": " My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. ",
      "47": " Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,  the same  loveth little. ",
      "48": "And he said unto her,  Thy sins are forgiven. ",
      "49": "And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?",

      "4": "And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:",
      "5": " A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. ",
      "6": " And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture. ",
      "7": " And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it. ",
      "8": " And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold.  And when he had said these things, he cried,  He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. ",
      "9": "And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?",
      "10": "And he said,  Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that  seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.  ",
      "11": " Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. ",
      "12": " Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. ",
      "13": "  They on the rock  are they , which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away. ",
      "14": " And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of  this  life, and bring no fruit to perfection. ",
      "15": " But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep  it , and bring forth fruit with patience. ",

      "48": "And he said unto her,  Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace. ",
      "49": "While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's  house , saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.",
