      "12": "Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?",
      "13": "But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:",
      "14": "And if Christ be not risen, then  is  our preaching vain, and your faith  is  also vain.",
      "15": "Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.",
      "16": "For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:",
      "17": "And if Christ be not raised, your faith  is  vain; ye are yet in your sins.",

      "19": "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. ",
      "20": "But now is Christ risen from the dead,  and  become the firstfruits of them that slept.",
      "21": "For since by man  came  death, by man  came  also the resurrection of the dead.",
      "22": "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.",
      "23": "But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.",
      "24": "Then  cometh  the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.",
      "25": "For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.",
      "26": "The last enemy  that  shall be destroyed  is  death.",
      "27": " For he hath put all things under his feet.  But when he saith, all things are put under  him, it is  manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.",
      "28": "And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.",
      "29": "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?",
      "30": "And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?",
      "31": "I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. ",
      "32": "If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not?  let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.  ",

      "34": "Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak  this  to your shame. ",
      "35": "But some  man  will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?",
      "36": " Thou  fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:",
      "37": "And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other  grain :",
      "38": "But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.",
      "39": "All flesh  is  not the same flesh: but  there is  one  kind of  flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes,  and  another of birds.",
      "40": " There are  also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial  is  one, and the  glory  of the terrestrial  is  another.",
      "41": " There is  one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for  one  star differeth from  another  star in glory.",
      "42": "So also  is  the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:",
      "43": "It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:",
      "44": "It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.",
      "45": "And so it is written,  The first man Adam was made a living soul;  the last Adam  was made  a quickening spirit.",
      "46": "Howbeit that  was  not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.",
      "47": "The first man  is  of the earth, earthy: the second man  is  the Lord from heaven.",
      "48": "As  is  the earthy, such  are  they also that are earthy: and as  is  the heavenly, such  are  they also that are heavenly.",
      "49": "And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.",
      "50": "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. ",
      "51": "Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,",
      "52": "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.",
      "53": "For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal  must  put on immortality.",
      "54": "So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written,  Death is swallowed up in victory. ",
      "55": " O death, where  is  thy sting? O grave, where  is  thy victory?  ",
      "56": " The sting of death  is  sin; and the strength of sin  is  the law.",
      "57": "But thanks  be  to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. ",
      "58": "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. "
