      "14": " But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not,  (let him that readeth understand,)  then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains: ",
      "15": " And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter  therein , to take any thing out of his house: ",
