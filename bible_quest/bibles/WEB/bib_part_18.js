      "3": "All the elders of Israel came, and the priests picked up the ark.",
      "4": "They brought up Yahweh’s ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent. The priests and the Levites brought these up.",

      "49": "then hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place, and maintain their cause;",
      "50": "and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in which they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them",

      "54": "It was so, that when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, he arose from before Yahweh’s altar, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread out toward heaven.",
      "55": "He stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,",
      "56": "“Blessed be Yahweh, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. There has not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant.",

      "62": "The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.",
      "63": "Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to Yahweh, twenty two thousand head of cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated Yahweh’s house.",
      "64": "The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before Yahweh’s house; for there he offered the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings. ",
      "65": "So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven more days, even fourteen days.",
      "66": "On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad in their hearts for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant, and to Israel his people."

      "26": "Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. He kept them in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.",
      "27": "The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedars as common as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland.",
      "28": "The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt. The king’s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.",
