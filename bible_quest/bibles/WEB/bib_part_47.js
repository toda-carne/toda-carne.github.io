      "3": "He answered them,  “Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?  ",
      "4": " For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’      and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’    ",
      "5": " But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,”  ",

      "11": " That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”  ",
      "12": "Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?” ",
      "13": "But he answered,  “Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.  ",
      "14": " Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”  ",

      "17": " Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body?  ",
      "18": " But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.  ",
      "19": " For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.  ",
      "20": " These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”  ",

      "24": "But he answered,  “I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”  ",
      "25": "But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.” ",

      "27": "But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” ",
      "28": "Then Jesus answered her,  “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”  And her daughter was healed from that hour. ",
      "29": "Jesus departed from there and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up on the mountain and sat there.",
      "30": "Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,",
      "31": "so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel. ",
      "32": "Jesus summoned his disciples and said,  “I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.”   ",
      "33": "The disciples said to him, “Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?” ",
      "34": "Jesus said to them,  “How many loaves do you have?”  They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” ",
      "35": "He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;",
      "36": "and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.",

      "3": " In the morning, ‘It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times!  ",
      "4": " An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”  He left them and departed.",
      "5": "The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread.",

      "7": "They reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.” ",
      "8": "Jesus, perceiving it, said,  “Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, because you have brought no bread?  ",
      "9": " Don’t you yet perceive or remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up,  ",
      "10": " or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?  ",
      "11": " How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”   ",
      "12": "Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ",
      "13": "Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying,  “Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”  ",
      "14": "They said, “Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” ",

      "22": "Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.” ",
      "23": "But he turned and said to Peter,  “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.”  ",
      "24": "Then Jesus said to his disciples,  “If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.  ",
      "25": " For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it.  ",
      "26": " For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?  ",
      "27": " For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds.  ",
