      "11": " “Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.  ",
      "12": " Those along the road are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.  ",
      "13": " Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root. They believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation.  ",

      "15": " Those in the good ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance.  ",
      "16": " “No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a container or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that those who enter in may see the light.  ",
      "17": " For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light.  ",

      "29": "For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert. ",
      "30": "Jesus asked him,  “What is your name?”  He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him.",
