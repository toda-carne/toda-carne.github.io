      "3": "He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, then his mother said, “I most certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.” ",
      "4": "When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made a carved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah. ",

      "19": "They said to him, “Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us. Be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?” ",
      "20": "The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the people.",

      "27": "They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; then they burned the city with fire.",
      "28": "There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city and lived in it.",

Behold, the day is ending. Stay here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow go on your way early, that you may go home.”",
      "10": "But the man wouldn’t stay that night, but he rose up and went near Jebus (also called Jerusalem). With him were a couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine also was with him. ",

      "12": "“When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ when Yahweh your God was your king.",
      "13": "Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen and whom you have asked for. Behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.",
      "14": "If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God.",
      "15": "But if you will not listen to Yahweh’s voice, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then Yahweh’s hand will be against you, as it was against your fathers. ",
      "16": "“Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your eyes.",
      "17": "Isn’t it wheat harvest today? I will call to Yahweh, that he may send thunder and rain; and you will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in Yahweh’s sight, in asking for a king.” ",
      "18": "So Samuel called to Yahweh, and Yahweh sent thunder and rain that day. Then all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel. ",
      "19": "All the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for a king.” ",
      "20": "Samuel said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil; yet don’t turn away from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart.",
      "21": "Don’t turn away to go after vain things which can’t profit or deliver, for they are vain.",
      "22": "For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people for himself.",
      "23": "Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.",
      "24": "Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things he has done for you.",
      "25": "But if you keep doing evil, you will be consumed, both you and your king.”"
