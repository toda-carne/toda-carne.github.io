      "1": "Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years.  ",
      "2": "Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the people to their own tents.",
      "3": "Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”",
      "4": "All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was considered an abomination to the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.",
      "5": "The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel: thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.",
      "6": "When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits.",
      "7": "Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.",
      "8": "He stayed seven days, according to the time set by Samuel; but Samuel didn’t come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.",
      "9": "Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering to me here, and the peace offerings.” He offered the burnt offering. ",
      "10": "It came to pass that as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.",
      "11": "Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn’t come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash,",
      "12": "therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven’t entreated the favor of Yahweh.’ I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.” ",
      "13": "Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.",
      "14": "But now your kingdom will not continue. Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.” ",
      "15": "Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.",
      "16": "Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.",
      "17": "The raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;",
      "18": "another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.",
      "19": "Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears”;",
      "20": "but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, each man to sharpen his own plowshare, mattock, ax, and sickle.",
      "21": "The price was one payim  each to sharpen mattocks, plowshares, pitchforks, axes, and goads.",
      "22": "So it came to pass in the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. ",
      "23": "The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash."
    },
    "14": {
      "1": "Now it happened on a day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come! Let’s go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side.” But he didn’t tell his father.",
      "2": "Saul stayed in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree which is in Migron; and the people who were with him were about six hundred men,",
      "3": "including Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. The people didn’t know that Jonathan was gone. ",
      "4": "Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines’ garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.",
      "5": "The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.",
      "6": "Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, “Come! Let’s go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that Yahweh will work for us, for there is no restraint on Yahweh to save by many or by few.” ",
      "7": "His armor bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Go, and behold, I am with you according to your heart.” ",
      "8": "Then Jonathan said, “Behold, we will pass over to the men, and we will reveal ourselves to them.",
      "9": "If they say this to us, ‘Wait until we come to you!’ then we will stand still in our place and will not go up to them.",
      "10": "But if they say this, ‘Come up to us!’ then we will go up, for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand. This shall be the sign to us.” ",
      "11": "Both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, “Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves!”",
      "12": "The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something!” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Come up after me, for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.”",
      "13": "Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his armor bearer after him, and they fell before Jonathan; and his armor bearer killed them after him.",
      "14": "That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in an acre of land. ",
      "15": "There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and the raiders also trembled; and the earth quaked, so there was an exceedingly great trembling.",
      "16": "The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude melted away and scattered.",
      "17": "Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Count now, and see who is missing from us.” When they had counted, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there. ",
      "18": "Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring God’s ark here.” For God’s ark was with the children of Israel at that time.",
      "19": "While Saul talked to the priest, the tumult that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased; and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand!” ",
      "20": "Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together, and came to the battle; and behold, they were all striking each other with their swords in very great confusion.",
      "21": "Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines before and who went up with them into the camp from all around, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.",
      "22": "Likewise all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle.",
      "23": "So Yahweh saved Israel that day; and the battle passed over by Beth Aven. ",
      "24": "The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adjured the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats any food until it is evening, and I am avenged of my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food. ",
      "25": "All the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.",
      "26": "When the people had come to the forest, behold, honey was dripping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.",
      "27": "But Jonathan didn’t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath. Therefore he put out the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes brightened.",
      "28": "Then one of the people answered, and said, “Your father directly commanded the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’” So the people were faint. ",
      "29": "Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land. Please look how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.",
      "30": "How much more, if perhaps the people had eaten freely today of the plunder of their enemies which they found? For now there has been no great slaughter among the Philistines.”",
      "31": "They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. The people were very faint;",
      "32": "and the people pounced on the plunder, and took sheep, cattle, and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.",
      "33": "Then they told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against Yahweh, in that they eat meat with the blood.” He said, “You have dealt treacherously. Roll a large stone to me today!”",
      "34": "Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them, ‘Every man bring me here his ox, and every man his sheep, and kill them here, and eat; and don’t sin against Yahweh in eating meat with the blood.’” All the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and killed them there. ",
      "35": "Saul built an altar to Yahweh. This was the first altar that he built to Yahweh.",
      "36": "Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines by night, and take plunder among them until the morning light. Let’s not leave a man of them.” They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” Then the priest said, “Let’s draw near here to God.” ",
      "37": "Saul asked counsel of God: “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But he didn’t answer him that day.",
      "38": "Saul said, “Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see in whom this sin has been today.",
      "39": "For as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it is in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But there was not a man among all the people who answered him.",
      "40": "Then he said to all Israel, “You be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.” ",
      "41": "Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, “Show the right.” Jonathan and Saul were chosen, but the people escaped. ",
      "42": "Saul said, “Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son.” Jonathan was selected. ",
      "43": "Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done!” Jonathan told him, and said, “I certainly did taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold, I must die.” ",
      "44": "Saul said, “God do so and more also; for you shall surely die, Jonathan.” ",
      "45": "The people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? Far from it! As Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground, for he has worked with God today!” So the people rescued Jonathan, so he didn’t die.",
      "46": "Then Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place. ",
      "47": "Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned himself, he defeated them.",
      "48": "He did valiantly and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.",
      "49": "Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal.",
      "50": "The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.",
      "51": "Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. ",
      "52": "There was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man or any valiant man, he took him into his service."
    },
    "15": {
      "1": "Samuel said to Saul, “Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel. Now therefore listen to the voice of Yahweh’s words.",
      "2": "Yahweh of Armies says, ‘I remember what Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way when he came up out of Egypt.",
      "3": "Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don’t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’” ",
      "4": "Saul summoned the people, and counted them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.",
      "5": "Saul came to the city of Amalek, and set an ambush in the valley.",
      "6": "Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. ",
      "7": "Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is before Egypt.",
      "8": "He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.",
      "9": "But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, of the cattle, of the fat calves, of the lambs, and all that was good, and were not willing to utterly destroy them; but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. ",
      "10": "Then Yahweh’s word came to Samuel, saying,",
      "11": "“It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king, for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.” Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night. ",
      "12": "Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and Samuel was told, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, turned, passed on, and went down to Gilgal.” ",
      "13": "Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, “You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.” ",
      "14": "Samuel said, “Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?” ",
      "15": "Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. We have utterly destroyed the rest.” ",
      "16": "Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh said to me last night.” He said to him, “Say on.” ",
      "17": "Samuel said, “Though you were little in your own sight, weren’t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;",
      "18": "and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, ‘Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.’",
      "19": "Why then didn’t you obey Yahweh’s voice, but took the plunder, and did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight?” ",
      "20": "Saul said to Samuel, “But I have obeyed Yahweh’s voice, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.",
      "21": "But the people took of the plunder, sheep and cattle, the best of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.” ",
      "22": "Samuel said, “Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying Yahweh’s voice? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.",
      "23": "For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim.  Because you have rejected Yahweh’s word, he has also rejected you from being king.” ",
      "24": "Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.",
      "25": "Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.” ",
      "26": "Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected Yahweh’s word, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.”",
      "27": "As Samuel turned around to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.",
      "28": "Samuel said to him, “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.",
      "29": "Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.” ",
      "30": "Then he said, “I have sinned; yet please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.” ",
      "31": "So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.",
      "32": "Then Samuel said, “Bring Agag the king of the Amalekites here to me!” Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” ",
      "33": "Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women!” Then Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal. ",
      "34": "Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.",
      "35": "Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death, but Samuel mourned for Saul. Yahweh grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel."
    },
    "16": {
      "1": "Yahweh said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have provided a king for myself among his sons.” ",
      "2": "Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.” Yahweh said, “Take a heifer with you, and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.’",
      "3": "Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.” ",
      "4": "Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, “Do you come peaceably?” ",
      "5": "He said, “Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.” He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.",
      "6": "When they had come, he looked at Eliab, and said, “Surely Yahweh’s anointed is before him.” ",
      "7": "But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Don’t look on his face, or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for I don’t see as man sees. For man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.” ",
      "8": "Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”",
      "9": "Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one, either.”",
      "10": "Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not chosen these.”",
      "11": "Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your children here?” He said, “There remains yet the youngest. Behold, he is keeping the sheep.” Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and get him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.” ",
      "12": "He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, with a handsome face and good appearance. Yahweh said, “Arise! Anoint him, for this is he.” ",
      "13": "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the middle of his brothers. Then Yahweh’s Spirit came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.",
      "14": "Now Yahweh’s Spirit departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.",
      "15": "Saul’s servants said to him, “See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.",
      "16": "Let our lord now command your servants who are in front of you to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. Then when the evil spirit from God is on you, he will play with his hand, and you will be well.” ",
      "17": "Saul said to his servants, “Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.” ",
      "18": "Then one of the young men answered and said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and Yahweh is with him.” ",
      "19": "Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.” ",
      "20": "Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a container of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.",
      "21": "David came to Saul and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.",
      "22": "Saul sent to Jesse, saying, “Please let David stand before me, for he has found favor in my sight.”",
      "23": "When the spirit from God was on Saul, David took the harp and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him."
    },
    "17": {
      "1": "Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle; and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephesdammim.",
      "2": "Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.",
      "3": "The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.",
      "4": "A champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span  went out.",
      "5": "He had a helmet of bronze on his head, and he wore a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels  of bronze.",
      "6": "He had bronze shin armor on his legs and a bronze javelin between his shoulders.",
      "7": "The staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron.  His shield bearer went before him.",
      "8": "He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, “Why have you come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? Choose a man for yourselves, and let him come down to me.",
      "9": "If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.”",
      "10": "The Philistine said, “I defy the armies of Israel today! Give me a man, that we may fight together!” ",
      "11": "When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.",
      "12": "Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons. The man was an elderly old man in the days of Saul.",
      "13": "The three oldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle; and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.",
      "14": "David was the youngest; and the three oldest followed Saul.",
      "15": "Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem. ",
      "16": "The Philistine came near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. ",
      "17": "Jesse said to David his son, “Now take for your brothers an ephah  of this parched grain and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers;",
      "18": "and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand; and see how your brothers are doing, and bring back news.”",
      "19": "Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. ",
      "20": "David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper, and took the provisions and went, as Jesse had commanded him. He came to the place of the wagons as the army which was going out to the fight shouted for the battle.",
      "21": "Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.",
      "22": "David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.",
      "23": "As he talked with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, came up out of the ranks of the Philistines, and said the same words; and David heard them.",
      "24": "All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him and were terrified.",
      "25": "The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who has come up? He has surely come up to defy Israel. The king will give great riches to the man who kills him, and will give him his daughter, and will make his father’s house tax-free in Israel.” ",
      "26": "David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, “What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” ",
      "27": "The people answered him in this way, saying, “So shall it be done to the man who kills him.” ",
      "28": "Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger burned against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and the evil of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle.” ",
      "29": "David said, “What have I now done? Is there not a cause?”",
      "30": "He turned away from him toward another, and spoke like that again; and the people answered him again the same way.",
      "31": "When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.",
      "32": "David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail because of him. Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.” ",
      "33": "Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.” ",
      "34": "David said to Saul, “Your servant was keeping his father’s sheep; and when a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock,",
      "35": "I went out after him, struck him, and rescued it out of his mouth. When he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, struck him, and killed him.",
      "36": "Your servant struck both the lion and the bear. This uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, since he has defied the armies of the living God.”",
      "37": "David said, “Yahweh, who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.” Saul said to David, “Go! Yahweh will be with you.” ",
