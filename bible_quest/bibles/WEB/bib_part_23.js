      "3": "Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.",
      "4": "Abijah stood up on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel:",
      "5": "Ought you not to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?",
      "6": "Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.",
      "7": "Worthless men were gathered to him, wicked fellows who strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tender hearted, and could not withstand them. ",
      "8": "“Now you intend to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David. You are a great multitude, and the golden calves which Jeroboam made you for gods are with you.",
      "9": "Haven’t you driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made priests for yourselves according to the ways of the peoples of other lands? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may be a priest of those who are no gods. ",
      "10": "“But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not forsaken him. We have priests serving Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work.",
      "11": "They burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt offerings and sweet incense. They also set the show bread in order on the pure table, and care for the gold lamp stand with its lamps, to burn every evening; for we keep the instruction of Yahweh our God, but you have forsaken him.",
      "12": "Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you. Children of Israel, don’t fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers; for you will not prosper.” ",

      "16": "The children of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.",
      "17": "Abijah and his people killed them with a great slaughter, so five hundred thousand chosen men of Israel fell down slain.",
      "18": "Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.",
      "19": "Abijah pursued Jeroboam, and took cities from him: Bethel with its villages, Jeshanah with its villages, and Ephron with its villages. ",
      "20": "Jeroboam didn’t recover strength again in the days of Abijah. Yahweh struck him, and he died.",

      "3": "for he took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles,",
      "4": "and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to obey his law and command.",
      "5": "Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images; and the kingdom was quiet before him.",
      "6": "He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest.",
      "7": "For he said to Judah, “Let’s build these cities and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered. ",
      "8": "Asa had an army of three hundred thousand out of Judah who bore bucklers and spears, and two hundred eighty thousand out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor. ",
      "9": "Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million troops and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.",
      "10": "Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.",
      "11": "Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, there is no one besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God. Don’t let man prevail against you.” ",
      "12": "So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.",
      "13": "Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar. So many of the Ethiopians fell that they could not recover themselves, for they were destroyed before Yahweh and before his army. Judah’s army carried away very much booty.",
      "14": "They struck all the cities around Gerar, for the fear of Yahweh came on them. They plundered all the cities, for there was much plunder in them.",
      "15": "They also struck the tents of those who had livestock, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, then returned to Jerusalem."

      "3": "Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law.",
      "4": "But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.",
      "5": "In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands.",
      "6": "They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with all adversity.",
      "7": "But you be strong! Don’t let your hands be slack, for your work will be rewarded.” ",
      "8": "When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed Yahweh’s altar that was before Yahweh’s porch.",
      "9": "He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon; for they came to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.",
      "10": "So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.",
      "11": "They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the plunder which they had brought, seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep.",
      "12": "They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;",
      "13": "and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.",
      "14": "They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with cornets.",
      "15": "All Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them. Then Yahweh gave them rest all around. ",
      "16": "Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen mother, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; so Asa cut down her image, ground it into dust, and burned it at the brook Kidron.",
      "17": "But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.",
      "18": "He brought the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated, silver, gold, and vessels into God’s house.",

      "3": "“Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.” ",
      "4": "Ben Hadad listened to King Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.",
      "5": "When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease.",
      "6": "Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, with which Baasha had built; and he built Geba and Mizpah with them. ",
      "7": "At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.",
      "8": "Weren’t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and exceedingly many horsemen? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand.",
      "9": "For Yahweh’s eyes run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. You have done foolishly in this; for from now on you will have wars.” ",
      "10": "Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time. ",
