      "14": "When they had come, they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?",
      "15": "Shall we give, or shall we not give?” But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them,  “Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”  ",
      "16": "They brought it. He said to them,  “Whose is this image and inscription?”  They said to him, “Caesar’s.” ",

      "43": "He called his disciples to himself and said to them,  “Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,  ",
