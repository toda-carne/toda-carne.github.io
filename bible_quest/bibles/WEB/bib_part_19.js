      "1": "They continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.",
      "2": "In the third year, Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.",
      "3": "The king of Israel said to his servants, “You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we do nothing, and don’t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?”",
      "4": "He said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to battle to Ramoth Gilead?” Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”",
      "5": "Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please inquire first for Yahweh’s word.” ",
      "6": "Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Should I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or should I refrain?” They said, “Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.” ",
      "7": "But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of him?” ",
      "8": "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Yahweh, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.” Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.” ",
      "9": "Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, “Quickly get Micaiah the son of Imlah.” ",
      "10": "Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.",
      "11": "Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself horns of iron, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘With these you will push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’”",
      "12": "All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper; for Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.” ",
      "13": "The messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “See now, the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak good.” ",
      "14": "Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, what Yahweh says to me, that I will speak.” ",
      "15": "When he had come to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?” He answered him, “Go up and prosper; and Yahweh will deliver it into the hand of the king.” ",
      "16": "The king said to him, “How many times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in Yahweh’s name?” ",
      "17": "He said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. Yahweh said, ‘These have no master. Let them each return to his house in peace.’” ",
      "18": "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?” ",
      "19": "Micaiah said, “Therefore hear Yahweh’s word. I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.",
      "20": "Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ One said one thing, and another said another. ",
      "21": "A spirit came out and stood before Yahweh, and said, ‘I will entice him.’ ",
      "22": "Yahweh said to him, ‘How?’ He said, ‘I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ He said, ‘You will entice him, and will also prevail. Go out and do so.’",
      "23": "Now therefore, behold, Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you.” ",
      "24": "Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did Yahweh’s Spirit go from me to speak to you?” ",

      "26": "The king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son.",
      "27": "Say, ‘The king says, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.”’” ",
      "28": "Micaiah said, “If you return at all in peace, Yahweh has not spoken by me.” He said, “Listen, all you people!” ",
      "29": "So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.",
      "30": "The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you put on your robes.” The king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle. ",
      "31": "Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, “Don’t fight with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.” ",
      "32": "When the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely that is the king of Israel!” and they came over to fight against him. Jehoshaphat cried out.",
      "33": "When the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.",
      "34": "A certain man drew his bow at random, and struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around, and carry me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded.”",
      "35": "The battle increased that day. The king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.",
      "36": "A cry went throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, “Every man to his city, and every man to his country!” ",
      "37": "So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria.",
      "38": "They washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves, according to Yahweh’s word which he spoke. ",
      "39": "Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?",
      "40": "So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place. ",
      "41": "Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.",

      "43": "He walked in all the way of Asa his father. He didn’t turn away from it, doing that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes. However, the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.",
      "44": "Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. ",
      "45": "Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he fought, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?",
      "46": "The remnant of the sodomites, that remained in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land.",
      "47": "There was no king in Edom. A deputy ruled.",
      "48": "Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they didn’t go, for the ships wrecked at Ezion Geber.",
      "49": "Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not.",
      "50": "Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in his father David’s city. Jehoram his son reigned in his place. ",
      "51": "Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.",
      "52": "He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, in which he made Israel to sin.",
      "53": "He served Baal and worshiped him, and provoked Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger in all the ways that his father had done so."

      "1": "Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. ",
      "2": "Ahaziah fell down through the lattice in his upper room that was in Samaria, and was sick. So he sent messengers, and said to them, “Go, inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I will recover of this sickness.” ",
      "3": "But Yahweh’s  angel said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and tell them, ‘Is it because there is no God  in Israel that you go to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron?",
      "4": "Now therefore Yahweh says, “You will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.”’” Then Elijah departed. ",
      "5": "The messengers returned to him, and he said to them, “Why is it that you have returned?” ",
      "6": "They said to him, “A man came up to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go, return to the king who sent you, and tell him, “Yahweh says, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you send to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’”’” ",
      "7": "He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came up to meet you and told you these words?” ",
      "8": "They answered him, “He was a hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist.” He said, “It’s Elijah the Tishbite.” ",
      "9": "Then the king sent a captain of fifty with his fifty to him. He went up to him; and behold,  he was sitting on the top of the hill. He said to him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down!’” ",
      "10": "Elijah answered to the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty. ",
      "11": "Again he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. He answered him, “Man of God, the king has said, ‘Come down quickly!’” ",
      "12": "Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your fifty!” Then God’s fire came down from the sky, and consumed him and his fifty. ",
      "13": "Again he sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. The third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him, and said to him, “Man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty of your servants be precious in your sight.",
      "14": "Behold, fire came down from the sky and consumed the last two captains of fifty with their fifties. But now let my life be precious in your sight.” ",
      "15": "Yahweh’s angel said to Elijah, “Go down with him. Don’t be afraid of him.” Then he arose and went down with him to the king.",
      "16": "He said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal Zebub, the god of Ekron, is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? Therefore you will not come down from the bed where you have gone up, but you will surely die.’” ",
      "17": "So he died according to Yahweh’s word which Elijah had spoken. Jehoram began to reign in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, because he had no son.",
      "18": "Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"

      "1": "When Yahweh was about to take Elijah up by a whirlwind into heaven, Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.",
      "2": "Elijah said to Elisha, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me as far as Bethel.” Elisha said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they went down to Bethel. ",
      "3": "The sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from over you today?” He said, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.” ",
      "4": "Elijah said to him, “Elisha, please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to Jericho.” He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” So they came to Jericho. ",
      "5": "The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said to him, “Do you know that Yahweh will take away your master from over you today?” He answered, “Yes, I know it. Hold your peace.” ",
      "6": "Elijah said to him, “Please wait here, for Yahweh has sent me to the Jordan.” He said, “As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.” Then they both went on.",
      "7": "Fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite them at a distance; and they both stood by the Jordan.",
      "8": "Elijah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the waters; and they were divided here and there, so that they both went over on dry ground.",
      "9": "When they had gone over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you.” Elisha said, “Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me.” ",
      "10": "He said, “You have asked a hard thing. If you see me when I am taken from you, it will be so for you; but if not, it will not be so.” ",
      "11": "As they continued on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.",
      "12": "Elisha saw it, and he cried, “My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!” He saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them in two pieces.",
      "13": "He also took up Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.",
      "14": "He took Elijah’s mantle that fell from him, and struck the waters, and said, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” When he also had struck the waters, they were divided apart, and Elisha went over. ",
      "15": "When the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho facing him saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.",
      "16": "They said to him, “See now, there are with your servants fifty strong men. Please let them go and seek your master. Perhaps Yahweh’s Spirit has taken him up, and put him on some mountain or into some valley.” He said, “Don’t send them.” ",
      "17": "When they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, “Send them.” Therefore they sent fifty men; and they searched for three days, but didn’t find him.",
      "18": "They came back to him while he stayed at Jericho; and he said to them, “Didn’t I tell you, ‘Don’t go’?” ",
      "19": "The men of the city said to Elisha, “Behold, please, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is barren.” ",
      "20": "He said, “Bring me a new jar, and put salt in it.” Then they brought it to him.",
      "21": "He went out to the spring of the waters, and threw salt into it, and said, “Yahweh says, ‘I have healed these waters. There shall not be from there any more death or barren wasteland.’”",
      "22": "So the waters were healed to this day, according to Elisha’s word which he spoke. ",
      "23": "He went up from there to Bethel. As he was going up by the way, some youths came out of the city and mocked him, and said to him, “Go up, you baldy! Go up, you baldy!”",
      "24": "He looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in Yahweh’s name. Then two female bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of those youths.",

      "1": "Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.",
      "2": "He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, but not like his father and like his mother, for he put away the pillar of Baal that his father had made.",
      "3": "Nevertheless he held to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from them. ",
      "4": "Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he supplied the king of Israel with one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.",
      "5": "But when Ahab was dead, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.",
      "6": "King Jehoram went out of Samaria at that time, and mustered all Israel.",

      "8": "Then he said, “Which way shall we go up?” Jehoram answered, “The way of the wilderness of Edom.” ",
      "9": "So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they marched for seven days along a circuitous route. There was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.",
      "10": "The king of Israel said, “Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.” ",
      "11": "But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of Yahweh here, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him?” One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah, is here.” ",
      "12": "Jehoshaphat said, “Yahweh’s word is with him.” So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. ",
      "13": "Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.” The king of Israel said to him, “No, for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.” ",
      "14": "Elisha said, “As Yahweh of Armies lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I respect the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.",
      "15": "But now bring me a musician.” When the musician played, Yahweh’s hand came on him.",
      "16": "He said, “Yahweh says, ‘Make this valley full of trenches.’",
      "17": "For Yahweh says, ‘You will not see wind, neither will you see rain, yet that valley will be filled with water, and you will drink, both you and your livestock and your other animals.",
      "18": "This is an easy thing in Yahweh’s sight. He will also deliver the Moabites into your hand.",
      "19": "You shall strike every fortified city and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all springs of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.’” ",
      "20": "In the morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. ",
      "21": "Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, young and old, and stood on the border.",
      "22": "They rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.",
      "23": "They said, “This is blood. The kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each other. Now therefore, Moab, to the plunder!” ",
      "24": "When they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went forward into the land attacking the Moabites.",
      "25": "They beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone, and filled it. They also stopped all the springs of water and cut down all the good trees, until in Kir Hareseth all they left was its stones; however the men armed with slings went around it and attacked it.",
      "26": "When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too severe for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew a sword, to break through to the king of Edom; but they could not.",
      "27": "Then he took his oldest son who would have reigned in his place, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. There was great wrath against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land."
