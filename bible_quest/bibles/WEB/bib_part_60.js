      "5": "By faith Enoch was taken away, so that he wouldn’t see death, and he was not found, because God translated him. For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God.",
      "6": "Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him. ",

      "12": "Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead. ",
      "13": "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen  them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.",
      "14": "For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.",
      "15": "If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return.",

      "26": "considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.",
      "27": "By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.",

      "8": "But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then you are illegitimate, and not children.",
      "9": "Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?",
      "10": "For they indeed for a few days disciplined us as seemed good to them, but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.",
      "11": "All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.",
      "12": "Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,  ",
      "13": "and make straight paths for your feet,  so what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed. ",

      "16": "lest there be any sexually immoral person or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.",
      "17": "For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears. ",
      "18": "For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,",
      "19": "the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,",

      "24": "to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,  and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel. ",
      "25": "See that you don’t refuse him who speaks. For if they didn’t escape when they refused him who warned on the earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,",
      "26": "whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.” ",
      "27": "This phrase, “Yet once more” signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.",

      "5": "Be free from the love of money, content with such things as you have, for he has said, “I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way forsake you.” ",

      "11": "For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp. ",
      "12": "Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.",
      "13": "Let’s therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach.",
      "14": "For we don’t have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to come.",

      "5": "But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.",
      "6": "But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.",

      "22": "But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.",
      "23": "For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror;",
      "24": "for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.",
      "25": "But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom and continues, not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does. ",

      "10": "For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all.",
      "11": "For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”    also said, “Do not commit murder.”    Now if you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.",

      "17": "Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.",
      "18": "Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works. ",

      "22": "You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected.",
      "23": "So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness,”  and he was called the friend of God.",
      "24": "You see then that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.",
      "25": "In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?",
