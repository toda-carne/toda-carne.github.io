      "17": "There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel who didn’t go out after Israel. They left the city open, and pursued Israel. ",
      "18": "Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.” Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.",
      "19": "The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and entered into the city and took it. They hurried and set the city on fire.",

      "24": "When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.",
      "25": "All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the people of Ai.",
      "26": "For Joshua didn’t draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.",
      "27": "Israel took for themselves only the livestock and the goods of that city, according to Yahweh’s word which he commanded Joshua.",
