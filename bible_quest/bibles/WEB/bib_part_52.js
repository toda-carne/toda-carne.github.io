      "4": "He needed to pass through Samaria.",
      "5": "So he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.",
      "6": "Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.  ",
      "7": "A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her,  “Give me a drink.” ",
      "8": "For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. ",
      "9": "The Samaritan woman therefore said to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) ",
      "10": "Jesus answered her,  “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”  ",
      "11": "The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get that living water?",
      "12": "Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his children and his livestock?” ",
      "13": "Jesus answered her,  “Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,  ",
      "14": " but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”  ",
      "15": "The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come all the way here to draw.” ",
      "16": "Jesus said to her,  “Go, call your husband, and come here.”   ",
      "17": "The woman answered, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her,  “You said well, ‘I have no husband,’  ",
      "18": " for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.”  ",
      "19": "The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.",
      "20": "Our fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.” ",
      "21": "Jesus said to her,  “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.  ",
      "22": " You worship that which you don’t know. We worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.  ",
      "23": " But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshipers.  ",
      "24": " God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”  ",
      "25": "The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming, he who is called Christ.  When he has come, he will declare to us all things.” ",
      "26": "Jesus said to her,  “I am he, the one who speaks to you.”  ",
      "27": "Just then, his disciples came. They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?”",
      "28": "So the woman left her water pot, went away into the city, and said to the people,",
      "29": "“Come, see a man who told me everything that I have done. Can this be the Christ?”",
      "30": "They went out of the city, and were coming to him. ",
      "31": "In the meanwhile, the disciples urged him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” ",
      "32": "But he said to them,  “I have food to eat that you don’t know about.”  ",
      "33": "The disciples therefore said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?” ",
      "34": "Jesus said to them,  “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work.  ",
      "35": " Don’t you say, ‘There are yet four months until the harvest’? Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.  ",
      "36": " He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.  ",
      "37": " For in this the saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’  ",
      "38": " I sent you to reap that for which you haven’t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”  ",
      "39": "From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, “He told me everything that I have done.”",
      "40": "So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.",
      "41": "Many more believed because of his word.",
      "42": "They said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.” ",
      "43": "After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.",
      "44": "For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.",
      "45": "So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.",
      "46": "Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.",
      "47": "When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.",
      "48": "Jesus therefore said to him,  “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way believe.”  ",
      "49": "The nobleman said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” ",
      "50": "Jesus said to him,  “Go your way. Your son lives.”  The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.",
      "51": "As he was going down, his servants met him and reported, saying “Your child lives!”",
      "52": "So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour,  the fever left him.”",
      "53": "So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said to him,  “Your son lives.”  He believed, as did his whole house.",
      "54": "This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee."

      "1": "After these things, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda”, having five porches.",
      "3": "In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water;",
      "4": "for an angel went down at certain times into the pool and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had. ",
      "5": "A certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.",
      "6": "When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him,  “Do you want to be made well?”  ",
      "7": "The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.” ",
      "8": "Jesus said to him,  “Arise, take up your mat, and walk.”  ",
      "9": "Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked. Now that day was a Sabbath.",
      "10": "So the Jews said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.” ",
      "11": "He answered them, “He who made me well said to me,  ‘Take up your mat and walk.’  ” ",
      "12": "Then they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you,  ‘Take up your mat and walk’ ?” ",
      "13": "But he who was healed didn’t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place. ",
      "14": "Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him,  “Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”   ",
      "15": "The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.",
      "16": "For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.",
      "17": "But Jesus answered them,  “My Father is still working, so I am working, too.”  ",
      "18": "For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.",
      "19": "Jesus therefore answered them,  “Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.  ",
      "20": " For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.  ",
      "21": " For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.  ",
      "22": " For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,  ",
      "23": " that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him.  ",
      "24": " “Most certainly I tell you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life, and doesn’t come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.  ",
      "25": " Most certainly I tell you, the hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God’s voice; and those who hear will live.  ",
      "26": " For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.  ",
      "27": " He also gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.  ",
      "28": " Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice  ",
      "29": " and will come out; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.  ",
      "30": " I can of myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is righteous, because I don’t seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent me.  ",
      "31": " “If I testify about myself, my witness is not valid.  ",
      "32": " It is another who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies about me is true.  ",
      "33": " You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.  ",
      "34": " But the testimony which I receive is not from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved.  ",
      "35": " He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.  ",
      "36": " But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish, the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.  ",
      "37": " The Father himself, who sent me, has testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.  ",
      "38": " You don’t have his word living in you, because you don’t believe him whom he sent.  ",
      "39": " “You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about me.  ",
      "40": " Yet you will not come to me, that you may have life.  ",
      "41": " I don’t receive glory from men.  ",
      "42": " But I know you, that you don’t have God’s love in yourselves.  ",
      "43": " I have come in my Father’s name, and you don’t receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.  ",
      "44": " How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don’t seek the glory that comes from the only God?  ",
      "45": " “Don’t think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have set your hope.  ",
      "46": " For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.  ",
