      "3": "For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.",
      "4": "For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law,",

      "35": "Therefore don’t throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.",
      "36": "For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God, you may receive the promise. ",
      "37": "  “In a very little while,   he who comes will come and will not wait. ",
