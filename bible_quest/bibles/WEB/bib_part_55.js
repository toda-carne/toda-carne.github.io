      "14": "He said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.",

      "28": "The commanding officer answered, “I bought my citizenship for a great price.” Paul said, “But I was born a Roman.” ",
      "29": "Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him, and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.",
      "30": "But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them."

      "4": "Those who stood by said, “Do you malign God’s high priest?” ",
      "5": "Paul said, “I didn’t know, brothers, that he was high priest. For it is written, ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’”  ",
      "6": "But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!” ",
      "7": "When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the crowd was divided.",
      "8": "For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.",
      "9": "A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’ part stood up, and contended, saying, “We find no evil in this man. But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let’s not fight against God!” ",
      "10": "When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the barracks. ",
      "11": "The following night, the Lord stood by him and said,  “Cheer up, Paul, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem, so you must testify also at Rome.”  ",

      "13": "There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.",
      "14": "They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, “We have bound ourselves under a great curse to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.",
      "15": "Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding officer that he should bring him down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to judge his case more exactly. We are ready to kill him before he comes near.” ",
      "16": "But Paul’s sister’s son heard they were lying in wait, and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.",
      "17": "Paul summoned one of the centurions and said, “Bring this young man to the commanding officer, for he has something to tell him.” ",
      "18": "So he took him and brought him to the commanding officer and said, “Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.” ",
      "19": "The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside, asked him privately, “What is it that you have to tell me?” ",
      "20": "He said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.",
      "21": "Therefore don’t yield to them, for more than forty men lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse to neither eat nor drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you.” ",
      "22": "So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him, “Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.” ",
      "23": "He called to himself two of the centurions, and said, “Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, with seventy horsemen and two hundred men armed with spears, at the third hour of the night.” ",

      "28": "Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their council.",
      "29": "I found him to be accused about questions of their law, but not to be charged with anything worthy of death or of imprisonment.",
      "30": "When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring their accusations against him before you. Farewell.” ",
      "31": "So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.",

      "33": "When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.",

      "4": "But that I don’t delay you, I entreat you to bear with us and hear a few words.",
      "5": "For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.",
      "6": "He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him. ",

      "13": "Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.",

      "19": "They ought to have been here before you and to make accusation if they had anything against me.",

      "22": "But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, “When Lysias, the commanding officer, comes down, I will decide your case.”",
      "23": "He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him. ",
      "24": "After some days, Felix came with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.",
      "25": "As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, “Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me, I will summon you.”",
      "26": "Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore also he sent for him more often and talked with him. ",

      "9": "But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be judged by me there concerning these things?” ",
      "10": "But Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well.",
      "11": "For if I have done wrong and have committed anything worthy of death, I don’t refuse to die; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!” ",

      "16": "I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction before the accused has met the accusers face to face and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.",
      "17": "When therefore they had come together here, I didn’t delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought.",
      "18": "When the accusers stood up, they brought no charges against him of such things as I supposed;",
      "19": "but had certain questions against him about their own religion and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.",
      "20": "Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.",
      "21": "But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar.” ",
      "22": "Agrippa said to Festus, “I also would like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he said, “you shall hear him.” ",

      "17": "For if by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ. ",
      "18": "So then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life.",
      "19": "For as through the one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many will be made righteous.",
      "20": "The law came in that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace abounded more exceedingly,",

      "4": "We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. ",
      "5": "For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will also be part of his resurrection;",
      "6": "knowing this, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be in bondage to sin.",
      "7": "For he who has died has been freed from sin.",
      "8": "But if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,",

      "10": "For the death that he died, he died to sin one time; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.",
      "11": "Thus consider yourselves also to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord. ",
      "12": "Therefore don’t let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.",
      "13": "Also, do not present your members to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.",
      "14": "For sin will not have dominion over you, for you are not under law, but under grace. ",
      "15": "What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!",
      "16": "Don’t you know that when you present yourselves as servants and obey someone, you are the servants of whomever you obey, whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?",
      "17": "But thanks be to God that, whereas you were bondservants of sin, you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were delivered.",

      "20": "For when you were servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.",
      "21": "What fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.",
      "22": "But now, being made free from sin and having become servants of God, you have your fruit of sanctification and the result of eternal life.",
      "23": "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."

      "3": "So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.",
      "4": "Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might produce fruit to God.",
      "5": "For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law worked in our members to bring out fruit to death.",
      "6": "But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter. ",

      "8": "But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.",
      "9": "I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.",
      "10": "The commandment which was for life, this I found to be for death;",

      "12": "Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, righteous, and good. ",
      "13": "Did then that which is good become death to me? May it never be! But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, was producing death in me through that which is good; that through the commandment sin might become exceedingly sinful.",
      "14": "For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, sold under sin.",
      "15": "For I don’t understand what I am doing. For I don’t practice what I desire to do; but what I hate, that I do.",
      "16": "But if what I don’t desire, that I do, I consent to the law that it is good.",
      "17": "So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.",
      "18": "For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwells no good thing. For desire is present with me, but I don’t find it doing that which is good.",
      "19": "For the good which I desire, I don’t do; but the evil which I don’t desire, that I practice.",
      "20": "But if what I don’t desire, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwells in me.",
      "21": "I find then the law that, while I desire to do good, evil is present.",
      "22": "For I delight in God’s law after the inward person,",
      "23": "but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.",
      "24": "What a wretched man I am! Who will deliver me out of the body of this death?",
      "25": "I thank God through Jesus Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I myself serve God’s law, but with the flesh, sin’s law."

      "4": "that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us who don’t walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.",
      "5": "For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.",
      "6": "For the mind of the flesh is death, but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;",

      "11": "But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you. ",
      "12": "So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.",
      "13": "For if you live after the flesh, you must die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.",
      "14": "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are children of God.",
      "15": "For you didn’t receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba!  Father!” ",
      "16": "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God;",
      "17": "and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him. ",
      "18": "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.",
      "19": "For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.",
      "20": "For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in hope",
      "21": "that the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.",
      "22": "For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.",
      "23": "Not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.",
      "24": "For we were saved in hope, but hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees?",
      "25": "But if we hope for that which we don’t see, we wait for it with patience. ",
      "26": "In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don’t know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can’t be uttered.",
      "27": "He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit’s mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God. ",
      "28": "We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose.",
      "29": "For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. ",
      "30": "Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified. ",
      "31": "What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?",
      "32": "He who didn’t spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?",
      "33": "Who could bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who justifies.",
      "34": "Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. ",
      "35": "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?",
      "36": "Even as it is written,   “For your sake we are killed all day long.   We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” ",
      "37": "  No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.",
      "38": "For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,",
      "39": "nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God’s love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
